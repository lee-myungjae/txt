68	Body functions	The physiological functions of body systems (including psychological functions).				
69	Body structures	"The anatomical parts of the body such as organs, limbs, and their components."				
70	Casemix	"A system that groups patients using information about the patient, their diagnoses, procedures, complexity, and needs. Used for resource allocation."				
71	Causal relationship (coding)	A relationship that exists if a condition is caused by another condition (e.g. on the same death certificate or in a morbidity coding situation where one condition or factor causes another condition).				
72	Classification	An exhaustive set of mutually exclusive categories to aggregate data at a pre-prescribed level of specialisation for a specific purpose.				
73	Cluster	A cluster are postcoordinated entities that are joined using either a forward slash (/) or ampersand (&).				
74	Content Model	A structured framework that captures the knowledge that underpins the definition of an entity.				
75	Derived classification	"Classifications, often tailored for use at the national or international level, or for use in a specialty, based upon reference classifications."				
76	Dual coding	"The process used in situations where clinical terms are coded in to two different classification systems or versions for purposes of comparison, transition, mapping, casemix grouping or understanding the implications of change from one system to another."				
77	Duration (coding)	The time-period between the onset of the disease and the time admission for care or death.				
78	Environmental factors	"The physical, social, and attitudinal environment in which people live and conduct their lives."				
79	Extension code	"Extension codes are lists of additional information that can be added to a stem code when users and settings are interested in reporting more detail. Extension codes are not mutually exclusive and should not be used alone in the context of statistical classification but must be added to a stem code. Extension codes may be used alone in another context, e.g. for device documentation. Not all extension codes can be used with every stem code. Extension codes can never appear in the first position in a cluster."				
80	Foundation Component	"A large collection of terms and their relationships, which describe health and health-related domains. Underlying data base content that holds all necessary information to generate print versions of the Tabular list and the alphabetical index as well as additional information that is needed to generate specialty linearisations of ICD-11 and country specific modifications. The mention of a term or entity in the foundation exclusively serves ontological purposes and indexing. Mention of a term or entity in the foundation does not mean approval or endorsement of a particular condition."				
81	Impairments	The problems in body function or structure such as a significant deviation or loss.				
82	Integrated coding	"Full use of all chapters of ICD-11 (including, codes from Western Medicine and Traditional Medicine (TM1) chapters) for classification of clinical terms."				
83	Modification rule	"When coding for mortality from death certificates, the procedure by which an ICD code for the starting point is replaced by another code, due to special instructions."				
84	Precoordination	Stem codes which contain all pertinent information about a documented clinical concept in a pre-combined fashion.				
85	Postcoordination	"The use of multiple codes (i.e. stem codes and/or extension codes) together to fully describe a documented clinical concept. Postcoordination is permitted by a matter of principle with all codes, as long as at least one stem code is used."				
86	Primary parent	A higher level entity that covers the full range or scope of another entity.				
87	Reference classifications	"Classifications that cover the main parameters of the health system – disease (ICD), disability, functioning, and health (ICF), and health interventions (ICHI)."				
88	Secondary parents	The ability to connect a specific entity within the classification to more than one parent.				
89	Sequence (coding)	"In the context of mortality coding, a set of conditions reported line by line with a causal relationship between each element."				
90	Starting point (coding)	"In the context of mortality coding, normally the condition or event reported that started the sequence of acceptable causal relationships ending with the terminal cause of death, or when a death certificate is correctly completed, the condition reported on the lowest used line in Part 1 of the death certificate."				
91	Stem code	"Codes in the Tabular list of ICD-11 that can be used alone. Stem codes may be entities or groupings of high relevance in any of the use cases or clinical conditions that should always be described as one single category. Stem codes are designed to ensure that in use cases that require only one code per case, meaningful information is collected."				
92	Terminal cause of death (coding)	The first condition entered on the first used line of Part 1 of the death certificate. Also known as immediate cause of death.				
93	Underlying cause of death	"The disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the unintentional injury or violence which produced the fatal injury."				
94	Verbal autopsy	A method used to ascertain the cause of a death based on an interview with next of kin or other caregivers where no physician can evaluate the deceased.				
95	1 Part 1 - An Introduction to ICD-11					
96	1.1International Classification of Diseases (ICD)					
97	"The International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) is a tool for recording, reporting and grouping conditions and factors that influence health. It contains categories for diseases and disorders, health related conditions, external causes of illness or death, anatomy, sites, activities, medicines, vaccines and more."					
98	"The purpose of the ICD is to allow the systematic recording, analysis, interpretation and comparison of mortality and morbidity data collected in different countries or regions and at different times."					
99	"ICD-11 has been designed to serve semantic interoperability of individual data, reusability of recorded data, for use cases other than health statistics, including decision support, resource allocation, reimbursement, guidelines and more."					
100	"The role of the WHO in maintenance and implementation support of ICD is described in the WHO constitution. In addition, implementation and use of the most recent revision of ICD in all member states are legally mandated by the WHO International Nomenclature Regulations and reiterated with revisions of ICD adopted by the World Health Assembly. This includes an updating mechanism between revisions and the ongoing development and implementation of the family of diseases- and health-related classifications (WHO-FIC). The ICD as the core classification linked to other related classifications, specialty versions and terminologies."					
101	"In health information systems, data needs to be reusable for epidemiological analysis, resource allocation or research, as well as for individual level uses like health documentation, decision support, or reimbursement. ICD provides highly detailed information, far beyond the level of statistical categories, using unique identifiers. This way for example rare diseases, special findings or individual medicines can be recorded and reported."					
102	"The ICD is used to translate diagnoses of diseases and other health problems into alphanumeric codes, allowing storage, retrieval, and analysis of the data. The ICD is the international standard diagnostic classification for all general epidemiological and many health management purposes. These purposes include analysis of general health situations in population groups, monitoring of incidence and prevalence of diseases, and examining other health problems in relation to other variables, such as the characteristics and circumstances of the affected individuals. ICD is also suitable for studies of financial aspects of a health system, such as billing or resource allocation."					
103	"The ICD has evolved over the past 150 years from an International List of Causes of Death to a comprehensive classification and terminology system. The ontology-based design of ICD-11 and the migration of its sibling classifications ICF and ICHI to the same ontological infrastructure has enabled the full integration of terminology and classification in a common platform. In that way lossless clinical documentation is possible (coding all the necessary details), statistical aggregation is an integrated feature, end-to-end digital solutions are provided and links to other terminologies for other uses are enabled."					
104	"The ICD is used to allocate the majority of global health resources. Users of the ICD include physicians, nurses, other health care providers, researchers, health information management professionals, coders, health information technology workers, analysts, policymakers, insurers, patient organisations, and many more."					
105	"The ICD is used in various settings at different levels of detail. It therefore includes an information framework that contains a fully specified set of health concepts and their characteristics and relationships from which appropriate code sets can be selected. The ICD11 ensures consistency with traditional use cases of earlier ICD versions, because it has been built with the past revisions in mind. Past data analyses based on older versions of ICD can be linked to analyses of data based on ICD11."					
106	"The ICD can therefore be used to record, classify and use otherwise data recorded under headings such as cause of death, diagnosis, reason for admission, conditions treated, additional diagnoses, risk factors and reason for consultation, which appear on a wide variety of health records and documents from which statistics are derived."					
107	1.1.1 Intended uses					
108	"The ICD has been designed to address the needs of a broad range of use cases, such as: causes of death, morbidity, epidemiology, casemix (Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG)), quality and patient safety, primary care, functioning assessment, research, prevention, substance (medication) or device safety, specific surveillance like antimicrobial resistance (AMR), cancer registration, injury research, as well as ensuring semantic interoperability for clinical documentation, decision support and guidelines or recommendations."					
109	"Detailed information and instructions for users on the different use cases are available in other sections of the guide, relating to mortality use and different morbidity uses. Where innovative uses of ICD are envisaged, it is recommended to consult with the WHO to make best use of the flexibility and features of ICD-11."					
110	1.1.2 Classification					
111	"A classification is ‘an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive categories to aggregate data at a pre-prescribed level of specialisation for a specific purpose’ (ISO 17115). A classification involves the categorisation of relevant concepts for the purposes of systematic recording or analysis. The categorisation is based on one or more logical rules. The purpose of a health classification varies. For example, it may be used in the analysis of cause of death (mortality), morbidity, or human functioning. Low frequency concepts tend to be grouped but rare concepts may be individually classified."					
112	"Coding is the process of assigning a code from a classification to represent a clinical concept for a specific purpose. Coding rules must be incorporated in the classification to achieve consistency of coding and comparability of coded data over time and place. Classifications are complementary to terminologies, since they are designed to be used for standardised coding of information for statistical purposes."					
113	ICD-11 is combining the elements of classification and terminology and is designed to be linked to other terminologies that may provide additional detail or serve different purposes. Coding in ICD-11 can draw on statistical codes and on Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).					
114	1.1.3 ICD in the context of the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC)					
115	The WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC) comprises classifications that have been endorsed by the WHO to describe various aspects of health and the health system in a consistent manner.					
116	"The WHO-FIC provides standardised building blocks for health information systems and consists of three broad groups: Reference classifications, Derived classifications, and Related classifications."					
117	"The Reference and the Derived classifications are based on the Foundation Component, which is a large collection of concepts (with synonyms and preferred terms) and their relationships, which describe health and health-related domains."					
118	"Terms and entities related to diseases and health-related problems are organised into the ICD, those pertaining to functioning into the ICF, and those related to interventions into ICHI (International Classification of Health Interventions). Terms from the Foundation Component may be used in more than one Reference classification."					
119	"Derived Classifications draw on terms that may come from one or more of the Reference Classifications. Within the WHO-FIC Family, Related classifications are regarded as complementary to the Reference and Derived classifications. Related classifications have their own sets of terms, but can also share terms as part of the WHO-FIC Family."					
120	"Figure 1: Relationships between the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC) and Related Classifications, the Foundation Component, and shared terms."					
121	"The purpose of the WHO-FIC is to assist the development of reliable statistical and other data systems at local, national, and international levels, with the aim of improving health status and health care. Health related information might sometimes require additional detail to that contained in the ICD. A group or ‘family’ of health relevant classifications covers these needs both by classification of domains different from those of the ICD and provision of more details for specific uses, e.g. cancer registration. The WHO-FIC designates a suite of integrated classification products that share similar features and can be used singularly or jointly to provide information on different aspects of health and health care systems. For example, the ICD as a reference classification is mainly used to capture mortality and morbidity information. Functioning is classified in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and health interventions in the International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI)."					
122	"The WHO-FIC provides a conceptual framework of information dimensions which are related to health and health management. In this way, it provides a common language that improves communication and permits comparisons of data within countries, across countries, health care disciplines, services, and time. The WHO and the WHO-FIC Network (including collaborating centres, Non-governmental Organisations (NGOs), and selected experts) ([https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/who-fic-maintenance] (https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/who-fic-maintenance)) strive to build the Family of International Classifications based on sound scientific and taxonomic principles, ensure that it is up-to-date, culturally appropriate and internationally applicable, and meet the needs of its different users by focusing on the multi-dimensional aspects of health."					
123	1.1.4 WHO-FIC: Reference Classifications					
124	"Reference classifications cover the main parameters of the health system, such as death and disease (ICD), disability, functioning, and health (ICF) and health interventions (ICHI). WHO-FIC reference classifications are a product of international agreements. They have achieved broad acceptance and official agreement for use and are approved and recommended as standards for international reporting on health. They may be used as models for the development or revision of other classifications. The three Reference classifications are:"					
125	1. International Classification of Diseases and Health Related Problems (ICD)					
126	"2. International Classification of Functioning, Disability & Health (ICF)"					
127	3. International Classification Health Interventions (ICHI)					
128	The Reference Classifications are based on the same Foundation Component and share sets of Extension Codes.					
129	"1.1.4.1 International Classification of Functioning, Disability & Health (ICF)"					
130	"The ICF is the WHO’s framework for measuring health and functioning/disability at both the individual and population levels. While the ICD classifies diseases and causes of death, the ICF classifies health and health-related domains. ICD and ICF together provide a framework to capture the full picture of health."					
131	"The ICF classifies health and health-related states in two parts. Part one deals with functioning and disability, described from the perspectives of the body, the individual, and society. It is composed of two components: Body functions and structures, and Activities and participation. Part two covers contextual factors and also has two components: Environmental factors and Personal factors, since an individual’s functioning occurs in a context. Work is proceeding on the development of a classification of personal factors to be included in the contextual factors."					
132	"Functioning is a generic term for body functions (e.g. memory), body structures (e.g. occipital lobe), and activities and participation (e.g. walking, engaging in paid work). It denotes the positive aspects of the interaction between an individual (related to the individual’s health) and that individual’s contextual factors (environmental and personal factors)."					
133	"Disability is an umbrella term for impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions. It denotes the negative aspects of the interaction between an individual (with a health condition) and that individual’s contextual factors (environmental and personal factors). Disabilities are envisioned as a continuum and therefore the ICF and the codes within it do not confer an international binary status of disabled/not disabled. Levels of disability can be used descriptively in clinical settings when formulating a case. Program and policy decision-makers can apply the ICF and specify their own standards for the level of disability as eligibility criteria that are relevant for specific purposes."					
134	ICF includes other relevant descriptions:					
135	Body functions are the physiological functions of body systems (including mental functions).					
136	"Body structures are anatomical parts of the body such as organs, limbs and their components."					
137	Impairments are problems in body function or structure such as a significant deviation or loss.					
138	Activity is the execution of a task or action by an individual.					
139	Activity limitations are difficulties an individual may have in executing activities.					
140	Participation is involvement in a life situation.					
141	Participation restrictions are problems an individual may experience in involvement in life situations.					
142	"Environmental factors make up the physical, social and attitudinal environment in which people live and conduct their lives."					
143	"ICF includes codes for Body Functions (b), Body Structures (s), Activities and Participation (d), and Environmental Factors (e)."					
144	"ICF codes are only complete with the presence of a qualifier, which denotes the level of health (i.e. severity of the problem from ‘no problem’ to ‘complete problem’). Without qualifiers, codes have no inherent meaning. The ICF acknowledges that every human being can experience a decrement in health and thereby experience some disability. Disabilities can be temporary and may be brief (such as staying home from work for a few days with the flu); they can also be chronic or permanent and may fluctuate in severity over time."					
145	"Personal factors are included in the ICF model of functioning and disability, but have not been classified in ICF because of the large social and cultural variants associated with them. The taxonomy has not been operationalized further due to challenges related to establishing cross-cultural applicability, resource constraints, and ethical considerations."					
146	1.1.4.2 The International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI)					
147	"ICHI includes interventions across all functional sectors of the health system, covering acute care, primary care, rehabilitation, assistance with functioning, prevention, public health, and ancillary services. Interventions delivered by all types of providers have been included. The importance of describing and classifying health interventions has long been understood. An International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) was published by WHO in 1978 but was not maintained. ICHI is much broader than the former ICPM because it includes the full range of health interventions. Development of ICHI began in 2007, as a joint effort of the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC) Network and WHO, based on the experience gathered with the development of several national classifications of health interventions."					
148	Table 1: Descriptions and terms used in creation of ICHI.					
149	Axes	Inclusions	Example			
150	The Target axis contains the entities on which the action is carried out.	"Anatomy, Human function, Person or client, Group or population"	"stomach, activities of daily living"			
151	The Action axis is defined as a deed which is done by an actor to a target during a health care intervention.	"Investigation, Treating, Managing, Informing, Assisting, Preventing"	"biopsy, vaccination"			
152	The Means axis contains the entities describing the processes and methods by which the action is carried out.	Approach: the process by which the target of the action is accessed	"open, endoscopic"			
153		Technique used as part of the action	"radiation, magnetic resonance"			
154		Method describing how the action is undertaken	"law enforcement, method of transport."			
155	The content of the axes has been restricted to attributes that are common to many interventions. In particular:					
156	"Devices have not been included as an axis because most interventions do not involve a device and devices change rapidly, however devices may be included as extension codes"					
157	"Drugs or other substances administered through an intervention are classified elsewhere (e.g. ICD, The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification with Defined Daily Doses (ATC/DDD), INN)."					
158	The coding system comprises a seven-character category structure for the three axes:					
159	Three letters for the Target					
160	Two letters for the Action					
161	Two letters for the Means					
162	"ICHI codes comprise valid seven letter combinations of the three axes. For each intervention included in ICHI, the appropriate seven letter combination is identified. Not every possible combination of the three axes represents a valid ICHI domain."					
163	1.1.4.3 WHO-FIC: Derived classifications					
164	"Derived classifications are often tailored for use at the national or international level or for use in a particular specialty. They are based on reference classifications (i.e. ICD, ICF, ICHI). Derived classifications may be prepared by:"					
165	adopting the reference classification structure and classes					
166	providing additional detail beyond that provided by the reference classification					
167	rearrangement or by aggregation of items from one or more reference classifications.					
168	"ICD-11 has specialty linearisations that are derived from the common foundation. These include a version for dermatology, one for primary care and one for mental health. Others may follow."					
169	1.1.4.4 Related classifications					
170	Related classifications are included in the WHO Family of International Classifications to describe important aspects of health or the health system not covered by reference or derived classifications. Related classifications are:					
171	International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC)					
172	International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI)					
173	Technical aids for persons with disabilities (ISO9999)					
174	The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification with Defined Daily Doses (ATC/DDD)					
175	The International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP)					
176	1.1.5 ICD use in health information systems					
177	"Health information systems include a range of different components for collection, analysis, and use of health data. Information sources could, for example, be population-based, health facility-based, or focused on particular diseases. The main population-based sources of health information are civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems, census data, and household surveys."					
178	"Health facility-related data sources include public health surveillance, health services data (that may be referred to as health management information systems or routine health information systems (RHIS)), and health system monitoring data (e.g. human resources, health infrastructure, financing)."					
179	"National health accounts (NHA) are designed to provide a comprehensive picture of health financing. Coding enables the recording of health information in a language independent way. Standardisation of coding enables both intra- and international data comparison. For example, ICD coded data can be compared across different sectors of the health system – if the same coding rules are applied."					
180	Health information systems are increasingly based on digital (electronic) reporting and coding. ICD–11 is designed to be used in such environments. The content of this Reference Guide is the only additional document required when coding with ICD-11.					
181	In many places information collection is based on paper reporting in a traditional analogue way. ICD–11 can also be produced in a printed version for use in paper-based systems if needed (see 1.1.5.2).					
182	1.1.5.1 Use of ICD–11 in a digital setting and with web services					
183	"ICD-11 is used for coding of diagnoses, in electronic health records or with electronic death certificates, or in other digital data collections. Special tools like the ICD-11 Coding Tool facilitate finding specific ICD-11 codes for any of the several dimensions that define an ICD-11 entity or category. Additional details can be added using multiple codes for one condition. Retaining the unique identifier of the coded ICD-11 entity allows the same information to be reused across different translations. WHO has developed ICD web services (https://icd.who.int/icdapi); designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction."					
184	1.1.5.2 Use of ICD–11 in an analogue paper-based setting					
185	"ICD-11 can be used as an analogue printed version, if needed. Information is reported on hard copy documents and then coded manually with the ICD-11. It should be noted that paper-based recording requires manual transcription of the information into electronic systems and consideration should be given to moving to electronic reporting as early as possible in the information chain. Paper-based recording may cause problems with readability and timeliness of coded data. ICD-11 supports many ways of computer assisted coding including embedding of instructions for code combinations and other possible plausibility checks. The long-term goal for all users should be coding using ICD-11 in an electronic environment."					
186	"In the print version, the information is divided into 3 volumes, the Tabular list, the Reference Guide, and the Index. All three are needed to use the ICD correctly."					
187	1.1.5.3 Electronic version					
188	"In the browser version of the ICD, most information is interlinked and visible in the relevant context. The WHO provides this version for browsing ICD-11 in multiple languages (linked from https://icd.who.int). This tool allows the user to retrieve concepts by searching for terms, anatomy or any other element of the content model. With the browser, users can also contribute to the updating and continuous improvement of ICD with comments and suggestions. Such input is reviewed for consideration for inclusion on an annual basis."					
189	"ICD–11 can also be accessed using web services with user specific software. The IT guide to the ICD provides more details on compatibility requirements can be found on the following page: https://icd.who.int/icdapi. Both the web services and the online browser allow access and searching of all Tabular lists of the ICD, including for mortality and morbidity statistics, primary care, or for specialty linearisations for certain specific domains."					
190	1.1.6 Links with other Classifications and Terminologies					
191	"ICD coded entities or categories can be used in conjunction with other relevant health classifications and terminologies to fully document an episode of care, or a case for research."					
192	1.1.6.1 Integrated use with Terminologies					
193	"Classification involves grouping information according to logical rules. Terminology allows the reporting of information at any desired level of detail: for example, body parts, findings, or other elements that constitute a disease. Only items defined in a terminology can be reported (i.e. terminologies have no mechanism to report new information that has not previously been added to the terminology). In contrast, a classification has residual classes (‘other specified’ and ‘unspecified’) that ensure that all cases can always be classified. In a terminology, similar to a modern classification, a disease can be defined, for example by establishing linkages between its elements, such as anatomy or findings. Terminologies retain the information without emphasising any aspect of the recorded information."					
194	"In contrast, classifications allow for identification of ‘relevant parts’ of the content, for example, for public health purposes. International agreement about these relevant parts ensures sure that the aggregated information is internationally comparable. The standardised use of the aggregation logic of a classification and the standardised use of the detailed information of a terminology aim at the same result: comparability. Transparent international agreement processes are necessary in both cases, with integration of index and tabular lists, ICD has moved towards having its own terminology component."					
195	Terminologies and classifications should be considered complementary. ICD-11 Foundation is the terminological part of ICD-11 derived from the former ICD-10 Index and other sources. Third party terminologies ideally are linked to the ICD-11 Foundation in 1:1 relationships or “signposted from ICD-11 foundation in 1:n relationships. These links shall follow the recommendations by the mapping paper.					
196	1.1.6.2 Functioning in ICD and joint use with ICF overview					
197	"Historically, the ICD has used certain disability concepts as common disease or disorder entities, such as: blindness, deafness, learning disability, or paraplegia, as well as certain disability concepts for other purposes, such as ‘disability as a sequela of injury’, and ‘limitation of activities due to disability’. The ICF was developed after the publication of ICD–10."					
198	"In ICD-11, links with ICF have been created in terms of aligning the concepts of disease and functioning and facilitating the joint use."					
199	Conceptual alignment between ICD-11 and ICF has taken place in several areas.					
200	"Signs and symptoms in the ICD are aligned with body functions in the ICF, and ‘factors influencing health status’ in the ICD align with contextual factors in the ICF."					
201	ICD-11 categories related to visual impairment in the Ophthalmology Chapter (Chapter 09) have been aligned with the respective ICF taxonomy and definitions for seeing functions.					
202	Additional selected ICF categories are drawn from the component Activities and Participation and help to describe the functional limitations commonly associated with specific health conditions in a functioning pattern. The impact of a disease or disorder in the daily activities of a person may vary depending on the severity of the condition as well as the contextual factors (e.g. environmental factors) and possible co-morbidities. The ICD takes an approach that identifies ‘severity’ as a property of the disease/disorder and describes the impact of the health condition on the daily life of a person with a set of functioning codes.					
203	An optional functioning section has been embedded in ICD-11 to enable the classification and measurement of the impact of health conditions in terms of functioning.					
204	The ICD-11 functioning section provides two options for impact assessment and documentation:					
205	"use of an ICF-based generic assessment instrument (i.e. World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS) 2.0) and the Model Disability Survey (MDS) to generate an overall and domain specific functioning score. In order to obtain such scores, WHODAS 2.0 (like other clinical rating scales) has to be used as a whole (i.e. the full battery of questions). Further instructions on the use of WHODAS 2.0 are provided in the WHODAS Manual."					
206	use of a short-list of functioning categories derived from ICF Annex 9. These categories should be used with a generic 5-point qualifier indicating severity for reporting of functioning in health information systems.					
207	"Overall, the linkage between ICD-11 and ICF may assist with the following use cases:"					
208	evaluation for general medical practice (e.g. work in capacity assessment)					
209	evaluation for social benefits (e.g. disability pension)					
210	payment or reimbursement purposes					
211	"needs assessments (e.g. for rehabilitation, occupational assistance, long-term care)"					
212	outcome evaluation of interventions					
213	"Wherever full functioning reporting is desired and required, the ICF should be used. (see Section 2.11 for further information)"					
214	1.2 Structure and taxonomy of the ICD					
215	The chapter and block structure of the ICD has evolved in 11 iterations of the classification over 150 years. The authoring of ICD follows a set of rules that ensure the functional and structural integrity of the classification. The evolution of the ICD carefully balances the need for categories that match current knowledge while allowing statistical comparability over space and time.					
216	"The chapter structure of ICD reflects major aspects of diseases. Chapters are not intended to delimit areas of medical expertise or domains of specialties. The link to any specialty or reimbursement schemes is secondary. The ICD has categories for diseases, disorders, syndromes, signs, symptoms, findings, injuries, external causes of morbidity and mortality, factors influencing health status, reasons for encounter of the health system, and traditional medicine. ICD-11 complements these by allowing capture of additional details such as anatomy, substances, medications, medical devices, infectious agents, place of injury, and many more. ICD-11 also comes with a set of rules and explanations for its use and necessary metadata. Required reporting formats are also included."					
217	"The most widespread use of ICD over time and geographically is for cause of death (mortality) statistics. ICD is also used for classification of clinical documentation, to provide standardised, language independent information for morbidity use, such as resource allocation, casemix, patient safety and quality of care, as well as primary care and research. ICD and its descriptions are also used as a framework in legislation."					
218	1.2.1 Taxonomy					
219	"A statistical classification of diseases must be confined to a limited number of mutually exclusive categories able to encompass the complete range of morbid conditions. The categories are chosen to facilitate the statistical study of disease phenomena. Every disease or morbid condition must have a well-defined place in the list of categories. Consequently, throughout the classification, there are residual categories for other and miscellaneous conditions that do not have their own unique category or which cannot be allocated to the more specific categories. However, the ICD-11 Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) allow retention of such detail for future analysis. The following measures apply in determining whether an entity qualifies to become a unique category:"					
220	1. Epidemiological evidence: frequency analyses of coded mortality and morbidity data					
221	2. Clinical evidence: disease evidence provided by the medical specialties					
222	3. Granularity: minimum detail reported and useful in mortality or primary care					
223	4. Continuity: preservation of the level of detail pre-existing in ICD					
224	5. Parsimony: the need to limit the number of categories for international mandatory reporting					
225	"A statistical classification can allow for different levels of detail if it has a hierarchical structure and subdivisions. A statistical classification of diseases should retain the ability to both identify specific disease entities and to allow statistical presentation of data for broader groups, thus enabling the attainment of useful and understandable information. The same general principles apply to the classification of other health problems and reasons for contact with health care services, which are also incorporated in the ICD. The ICD was developed as a practical, rather than a purely theoretical classification, in which there are a number of compromises between classification based on aetiology, anatomical site, circumstances of onset, or other criteria."					
226	ICD-11 draws extensively on the method of combining several codes to describe a clinical condition to the desired level of detail. Its electronic architecture allows assignment of unique identifiers to any condition listed - independently whether the condition is grouped in a statistical class or whether it represents a class of its own. The two approaches together allow the option of keeping coding simple where diagnostic detail is limited; and alternatively adding detail where diagnostic reporting requires a high level of comprehensiveness and sophistication.					
227	1.2.1.1 Content model and definition of disease					
228	Content model					
229	For further information please see 3.4 The Content Model.					
230	Definition of disease					
231	A disease is usually defined using a set of relevant aspects drawn from the pattern below. A disease is a set of dysfunctions in any body system defined by:					
232	Property	Description				
233	Symptomatology or manifestations	"Known pattern of signs, symptoms, and related findings"				
234	Aetiology	An underlying explanatory mechanism				
235	Course and outcome	A distinct pattern of development over time				
236	Treatment response	A known pattern of response to interventions				
237	Linkage to genetic factors	"E.g. genotypes, patterns of gene expression, etc."				
238	Linkage to environmental factors	Factors of the environment that trigger presence of a disease				
239	1.2.2 ICD Chapter structure					
240	"The ICD is a variable-axis classification. The structure was developed out of that proposed by William Farr in the early days of international discussions on classification structure: epidemic diseases, constitutional or general diseases, local diseases arranged by site, developmental diseases, injuries."					
241	"These groups remain in the chapters of ICD–11. The structure has stood the test of time and, though in some ways arbitrary, is still regarded as more useful for general epidemiological purposes than any of the alternatives tested. The conservation of the structure acknowledges the need for stability while allowing incorporation of additional sections."					
242	"Special groups bring together conditions that would be inconveniently arranged for epidemiological study if they were to be scattered, for instance in a classification arranged primarily by anatomical site. "					
243	These conditions formulate the ‘special groups’ chapters:					
244	Chapter	Title				
245	1	Certain infectious or parasitic diseases				
246	2	Neoplasms				
247	3	Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs				
248	4	Diseases of the immune system				
249	18	"Pregnancy, childbirth, or the puerperium"				
250	19	Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period				
251	20	Developmental anomalies				
252	22	"Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external cause"				
253	"The distinction between the ‘special groups’ chapters and the ‘body systems’ chapters has practical implications for understanding the structure of the classification, for coding to it, and for interpreting statistics based on it. It has to be remembered that, in general, conditions are primarily classified to one of the ‘special groups’ chapters."					
254	"Where there is any doubt as to where a condition should be positioned, the ‘special groups’ chapters take priority. This principle is enforced in the ‘excludes’ notes at the beginning of each chapter in the ICD."					
255	1.2.3 Guiding principles for classification of special concepts					
256	"1. Clinical findings are located in Chapter 21 ‘Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified’. (e.g. ‘Abnormal serum enzyme levels’ or ‘Results of function studies of the circulatory system’)"					
257	"2. Manifestations of diseases, a relevant point for health intervention, are ‘clinical manifestations’ located in the body system chapter where they manifest. The underlying condition has to be coded as well. (e.g. myocarditis)"					
258	"3. Syndromes, where the aetiology is unknown, are allocated with the most relevant body system. (e.g. Costen syndrome is in the ‘Digestive’ chapter)"					
259	4. The number of categories with ‘due to’ in the title are restricted to certain exceptions. (e.g. acute bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus)					
260	"5. Very specific, chronic, postprocedural conditions are grouped at the end of the body system chapter where they manifest. (e.g. lymphoedema due to surgery or radiotherapy). Residual categories do not exist for these groups."					
261	"6. Acute postprocedural complications are identified by combinations of codes from body system or injury chapters, and external causes chapter (e.g. an unintentional puncture of an organ during an intervention is classified with a code for the injured organ (harm), a code describing what surgery caused the injury (cause), and a code identifying the unintentional puncture as the mode/mechanism of injury.)."					
262	7. Categories with mention of ‘multiple’ are restricted to exceptions and require coding of the different multiple conditions individually (e.g. multiple injuries are to be coded individually when possible).					
263	"8. Categories with mention of ‘sequelae’ are restricted to exceptions. The specific condition resulting as a sequela needs to be coded along with the underlying cause. In some instances, they will continue to exist with the label ‘late effects of…’ (e.g. late effects of cerebrovascular disease or late syphilis). ‘Sequelae’ include residual effects of diseases or disorders, injuries or poisonings specified as such, or as late effect of, arrested, cured, healed, inactive, old or quiescent condition unless there is evidence of active disease."					
264	9. Categories with mention of ‘history of’ are limited to exceptions (e.g. personal history of malignant neoplasms lists only the more frequent anatomical sites).					
265	10. High level groupings need to be meaningful.					
266	"11. Residual categories exist only where they are meaningful. (e.g. where conditions are either congenital or acquired, there is no ‘other’ residual, but there will be an ‘unspecified’ option)"					
267	1.2.4 General features of ICD-11					
268	The main structural innovation of ICD–11 is that it is built on a Foundation Component from which the Tabular lists (such as the classification for morbidity and mortality statistics) are derived.					
269	1.2.4.1 Code structure					
270	The codes of the ICD–11 are alphanumeric and cover the range from 1A00.00 to ZZ9Z.ZZ. These are referred to as stem codes. The structure of stem codes is described below:					
271	The first character of the code always relates to the chapter number. It may be a number or a letter.					
272	Codes starting with ‘X’ indicate an extension code (see 2.9).					
273	There is always a letter in the second position to differentiate ICD-11 codes from the codes in ICD–10.					
274	The inclusion of a forced number at the third character position prevents spelling ‘undesirable words’.					
275	The letters ‘O’ and ‘I’ are omitted to prevent confusion with the numbers ‘0’ and ‘1’.					
276	"For example, 1A00 is a code in Chapter 01, and BA00 is a code in Chapter 11."					
277	For example: ED1E.EE					
278	"E corresponds to a ‘base 34 number’ (0-9 and A-Z; excluding O, I);"					
279	"D corresponds to ‘base 24 number’ (A-Z; excluding O, I); and"					
280	1 corresponds to the ‘base 10 integers’ (0-9)					
281	"The first E starts with ‘1’ and is allocated for the chapter. (i.e. 1 is for the first chapter, 2: chapter 02, … A chapter 10, etc.)"					
282	"The terminal letter Y is reserved for the residual category ‘other specified’ and the terminal letter ‘Z’ is reserved for the residual category ‘unspecified’. For the chapters that have more than 240 blocks, ‘F’ (‘other specified’) and ‘G’ (‘unspecified’) are also used to indicate residual categories (due to limitations in the coding space)."					
283						
284						
285						
286	1.2.4.2 Uniform resource identifiers					
287	All entities have a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) which is a string of characters that uniquely identifies a particular ICD-11 entity. Each entity has a specific place in the hierarchy of groups and categories.					
288	1.2.4.3 Block codes					
289	"Higher level entities in ICD-11 (called ‘blocks’) may be used for reporting aggregated statistics. However, blocks do not have category codes as they are not supposed to be used in coding. Blocks have their own URIs (e.g. the URI for Neoplasms is http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1630407678). Blocks may also be referred to by block IDs. The code structure for block IDs are 11 characters long (e.g. “BlockL1-1A0”)."					
290	1.2.4.4 Stem codes					
291	"Codes in the Tabular list of ICD-11 that can be used alone. Stem codes may be entities or groupings of high relevance in any of the use cases, or clinical conditions that should always be described as one single category. Stem codes are designed to ensure that in use cases that require only one code per case, meaningful information is collected."					
292	1.2.4.5 Extension codes and postcoordination					
293	"The extension codes are comprised of groups of codes e.g. anatomy, agent, histopathology and other aspects that may be used to add detail to a stem code. Extension codes are not to be used alone in the context of statistical classification but must be added to a stem code. Extension codes may be used in another context, e.g. for device documentation. Not all extension codes can be used with every stem code. Refer to 2.9."					
294	"Postcoordination is a notable new feature in ICD-11 that creates the ability to link core diagnostic concepts (i.e. stem+stem code concepts) when desired, and/or to add clinical concepts captured in extension codes to primary stem code concepts. The linked diagnostic concepts are called a cluster. It should be emphasised that the postcoordination ability inherent in ICD-11 is one of the significant changes compared with ICD-10. A cluster describes one clinical concept as described by the health care practitioner. Postcoordination is by matter of principle permitted with all axes, as long as at least one stem code is used. API, Browser and coding tool facilitate postcoordination in certain areas. Other areas of postcoordination have to be coded individually, but may be supported by future updates of ICD-11, where need arises."					
295	1.2.4.6 Other general features					
296	"ICD–11 categories have short descriptions, plus long descriptions labelled ‘additional information’. The short description is a maximum of 100 words relating to the entity that states things that are always true about a disease or condition which are necessary to understand the scope of the rubric. It appears in the Tabular list of the classification. The long ‘additional information’ is the full description, without length restriction."					
297	"Special tabulation lists (refer to section 2.25) continue to exist in ICD-11, but there are three additional lists - the Startup Mortality List (SMoL), the list for verbal autopsy, and the list for infectious diseases by agent. Specialty linearisations allow the representation of content from the perspective of a specialty, such as dermatology or neurology, through the creation of subsets, and through the precoordination of more detail, if desired."					
298	1.2.5 Foundation Component and Tabular lists of ICD–11					
299	"The Foundation Component is a multidimensional collection of all ICD entities. It is an underlying database that holds all necessary information to generate print versions of the tabular list and the alphabetical index, as well as additional information that is needed to generate specialty linearisations of ICD-11 and country-specific modifications. Entities can be diseases, disorders, injuries, external causes, signs and symptoms. Some entities may be very broad, for example ‘injury of the arm’, while others are more detailed, for example ‘laceration of the skin of the thumb’. The Foundation Component also has the necessary information to use the entities to build a tabular list. The Foundation Component includes information on where and how a certain entity is represented in a Tabular list, whether it becomes a grouping, a category with a stem code, or whether it is mentioned as an index term in a particular category."					
300	"Several different Tabular lists can be built from the Foundation Component. Drawing on the same Foundation Component, a set of tabular lists that builds on the same hierarchical tree structure can be created – producing congruent tabular lists. The Foundation component includes instructions on how to combine certain codes in a Tabular list to achieve more detail in coding. These rules help coders and computer systems to visualise the permitted code combinations when they are using a Tabular list."					
301	"In a Tabular list, entities of the Foundation Component become categories. The categories are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive and linked to a mono hierarchical tree (that is, they have only one parent). The information related to an entity that has become a category and has multiple parents is still available from the Foundation Component. This information can be used to visualise that category in more than one place in the Tabular list, e.g. by showing them in black font in its place for reference tabulation and in grey font in any other place for browsing or alternative tabulations. ICD–11 has multiple congruent tabular lists with varying levels of detail."					
302	1.2.5.1 Precoordination and Postcoordination in ICD-11					
303	"A health condition may be described to any level of detail, by applying more than one code, or by ‘postcoordinating’ (i.e. combining):"					
304	"two or more stem codes, (e.g. code1/code2)"					
305	stem codes with one or more extension codes. (e.g. stem code&extension code1&extension code2)					
306	"In this manner, the classification can address a large number of clinical concepts with a limited range of categories."					
307	"Stem codes contain all pertinent information in a pre-combined fashion. This is referred to as ‘precoordination’. When additional detail that pertains to a condition is described by combining multiple codes, this is referred to as ‘postcoordination’. The combination of codes is called a cluster. Refer to 2.10."					
308	1.2.5.2 Multiple parenting					
309	"An entity may be correctly classified in two different places, e.g. by site or by aetiology. For a disease, such as oesophageal cancer, this would mean that it could be classified to cancers (malignant neoplasms) or to conditions of the digestive system. In the same way, cerebral ischaemic conditions could be classified to the vascular system or to the nervous system. A decision about which place a condition is in depends on international agreement and legacy."					
310	1.2.6 Language independent ICD entities					
311	"ICD-11 entities are language independent. The maintenance of the ICD-11 on an international level is handled in the English language but the content model of ICD–11 is language independent and allows binding of any desired language to the elements of its Foundation Component. In this way, an international translation base facilitates translations or multilingual browsing. (See 3.12 Annex A: ICD-11 Updating and Maintenance)"					
312	1.3 Main uses of the ICD: Mortality					
313	"Mortality statistics are widely used for medical research, monitoring of public health, evaluating health interventions, and planning and follow-up of health care. Rules adopted by the World Health Assembly (WHA) regarding the selection of a single cause or condition, from death certificates, for routine tabulation of mortality statistics are provided to standardise production of mortality data. Implementation of the ICD for mortality requires establishment of an infrastructure for reporting and storing information, design of information flows, quality assurance and feedback, and training for classification users working with the input or output of data."					
314	1.3.1 What is coded: Causes of death					
315	"The description of a single underlying cause of death, and selected approaches to capture further information on causes of death also reported on a death certificate, enables the identification of trends in health for a given population."					
316	"Effective public health interventions prevent harm or death by breaking the chain of events that lead to harm. For this purpose, the underlying cause of death has been defined as ‘(a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury’, and is selected for routine single-cause tabulation of mortality statistics. (See Section 2.20 for more information.)"					
317	1.4 Main Uses of the ICD: Morbidity					
318	"Morbidity data are used for statistical reporting mostly at national or local levels. While some of this statistical reporting is conducted within an academic research context, it is commonly conducted in applied settings to inform health system and public health agency decision-making. ICD coded data also forms the basis for different casemix systems, such as different varieties of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs). Coded morbidity data can also be used to inform a variety of clinical guidelines through provision of Foundation Component information on burden of disease."					
319	1.4.1 What is coded: patient conditions					
320	"The definition of main condition relates to the description of an episode of hospital-based care. The health care practitioner should record and identify as the main condition the one condition that is determined to be the reason for admission, established at the end of the episode of health care."					
321	"The health care practitioner responsible for the patient’s treatment is also responsible for documenting the patient’s health conditions. This information should be organised systematically by using standard recording methods. A properly completed record is essential for good patient management. It is also an essential prerequisite to the creation of a valid coded record of patient diagnoses, derived through a coding process from written information describing the patient’s medical condition. When a sound written record of patient conditions is available, successful coding of this information in ICD and associated classifications produces a valuable source of epidemiological and other statistical data on morbidity and other health care problems. The person transforming the information on the stated condition to codes (the ‘coder’) may be the health care practitioner or a clinical coder (who is not responsible for the patient’s treatment). In the latter situation, which is common among member countries, the coder depends on the adequacy of clinical documentation of patient conditions by health care practitioners in the medical record. The importance of clinical documentation by health care practitioners as the starting point for coded health data cannot be overstated, and needs to be underlined as being a matter of key significance within countries and internationally. This has implications for education on health information and clinical documentation within health care practitioner training programs. (See Section 1.4 for more information.)"					
322	1.5 Traditional Medicine					
323	"Traditional Medicine (TM) is an integral part of health services provided in many countries. International standardisation by including Traditional Medicine within the ICD allows for measuring, counting, comparing, formulating questions and monitoring over time. Although some countries have had national Traditional Medicine classification systems for many years, information from such systems has not been standardised or available globally."					
324	It is recommended that coding of cases with ICD-11’s chapter on Traditional Medicine disorders and patterns (TM1) be used in conjunction with the Western Medicine concepts of ICD Chapters 1-25.					
325	"As with other ICD chapters, the TM1 chapter is not designed to assess TM practice or the efficacy of any TM intervention. However, as a tool for classifying, diagnosing, counting, communicating and comparing TM conditions, it assists research and evaluation to assess the safety and efficacy of TM."					
326	See 3.12 Annex A: ICD-11 Updating and Maintenance for more detailed information.					
327	1.6 ICD maintenance					
328	"The ICD maintenance process allows for the updating of the ICD following evolution in the understanding of diseases, treatments, and prevention. It also ensures improvements and clarifications coming from daily use of ICD, and requests by Member States or any other interested party."					
329	"A standardised open process has been established to ensure that the proposed updates are collected, routed, reviewed, and duly considered before being implemented. A proposal and review mechanism on an online platform makes the process transparent. Workflows ensure that proposed changes are considered both from a medical and scientific perspective and from their value and place in a particular use case (See 3.12 Annex A: ICD-11 Updating and Maintenance)."					
330	1.6.1 Guiding principles of authoring process					
331	Allocation of entities in the classification follows a set of rules that serve to maintain the structural and functional integrity of the classification. The core set of rules listed here is complemented by additional rules that address special cases or serve to ensure consistent user guidance. They are listed in order of priority.					
332	"1. No changes to the classification, including movement of categories or groups between chapters, without rationale and documented change in aetiology or prevention method. (e.g. Chapter 04 - ‘Diseases of the immune system’ was added as a new chapter as there was sufficient scientific evidence to support this move). Alternatively, it was suggested to move ‘wounds of skin’ to ‘Diseases of the skin’. The wound of the skin, being an injury, remains grouped with injuries because prevention will focus on the cause of the wound."					
333	2. Conditions are classified predominantly by their aetiology.					
334	Local manifestations of important ‘aetiologies’ are located in the aetiology chapter (e.g. Viral hepatitis is in ‘Certain infectious or parasitic disease’).					
335	"Where one condition can be due to multiple different aetiologies, and it is more relevant to retain the affected body system, it is usually classified with the body system (e.g. some gastric ulcers are caused by bacteria, but they remain in the ‘Digestive system’ chapter)."					
336	"Where the aetiology of the condition is unknown, it is allocated to the most relevant organ system (e.g. Costen syndrome is in the ‘Digestive system’ chapter)."					
337	Systemic ‘aetiologies’ are primarily in their relevant aetiology chapter (e.g. Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy is in “Diseases of the immune system”).					
338	3. Conditions that could arguably be in two or more places of the classification remain in their legacy location.					
339	"For example, injuries of the eye are equally important for the eye and their prevention. Despite the suggestion of including them in the eye chapter, they remained where they were, in the injury chapter."					
340	"Where aetiology and body system are equally important, the legacy location remains unchanged (e.g. ocular motor nerve palsies)."					
341	"4. Keeping a group of subtypes together in one location may override anatomical or aetiological considerations (e.g. human prion diseases - some have a genetic component, others a transmissible component)."					
342	1.6.2 Improving user guidance					
343	The following rules serve to provide user guidance. Users may expect to find conditions in certain places when browsing the tree structure. User groups may need to group data or create subsets for other reasons. The multiple parenting in the Foundation Component serves to address that issue.					
344	"1. Where a condition could be in two or more places, identify these other places and add them as secondary parents, e.g. malignant neoplasm of the colon is coded to the neoplasm chapter, but is also shown in the chapter of diseases of the digestive system. In case a set of conditions needs to be shown in more than one place and there is no grouping matching that set, create a window (no primary children, no terms, no residual categories) in the appropriate place."					
345	"2. Where a condition could be confused with another condition bearing a similar name, add an exclusion note. (e.g. ‘Influenza due to seasonal influenza virus’ has a note ’Exclusion: Haemophilus influenzae [H. influenzae] meningitis’)."					
346	"3. Where alternative ways of tabulating data are required, create a special linearisation list as a second parent (e.g. infectious diseases by agent). The coding scheme of the individual entries will remain the one used for the full international classification."					
347	"4. Where diseases of certain body systems are spread across different chapters, allow for a specialty linearisation of the pertinent diseases. The coding scheme of the individual entries will remain the one used for the full international classification. Currently there are specialty linearisations for primary care, dermatology, neurology, ophthalmology, and in special cases such as the International Classification of Disease for Oncology (ICD-O) and the International Classification of External Causes of Injury (ICECI)."					
348	1.6.3 Introduction to the ICD–11 Update Process					
349	"Official releases of the ICD-11 classification are produced annually for international use in mortality and morbidity (This is known as the ‘blue browser’). By contrast, the ICD-11 Foundation Component is continuously updated. A standardised process has been established to ensure that the proposed updates are collected, routed, reviewed, and duly considered before being implemented."					
350	The updating is carried out at different levels with different frequencies. Updates that impact on the four- and five-character codes will be published every five years. Updates at a more detailed level are published more frequently. Additions to the index are done on an ongoing basis. Mortality and morbidity rules that have significant impact on statistical output will be updated in long-term cycles of every 10 years.					
351	"Any individual user of the classification can submit a proposal for an update to the ICD. Such updates can refer to one or more entities of the ICD. They may address the position of entities in a tabular list, in the Foundation Component, and any element of the content model. The maintenance platform of ICD-11 (known as the ‘orange browser’) is used for proposals and comments. Any input to ICD-11 and its components requires proper referencing of sources, details of scientific evidence, and permission from the owner of any copyright materials (where applicable)."					
352	1.6.4 National Modifications for morbidity coding					
353	"The use of ICD in the specific context of the health care system of a country may require detail that is not currently part of ICD-11, for example, due to specific settings or due to reimbursement system requirements. Such changes will be subject to the same international process as are all other changes to ICD and will then become part of the Foundation Component and eventually of the Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (MMS), ideally prior to their implementation in the requesting country."					
354	"A situation may arise, where a national government or a related national institution needs a modification to be implemented immediately. In such circumstances, conflicts with the current Foundation Component must be avoided, and the relevant changes will be subject to special mechanisms for the international updating process. All countries planning to produce national modifications must make relevant contractual arrangements with WHO. This includes regulations on distribution within and outside the respective country and the resources necessary for the WHO to add such changes to the foundation."					
355	For developing a national modification of ICD-11 the following rules must be adhered to:					
356	"1. Ideally, modifications will be agreed by the ICD-11 maintenance bodies before they are implemented nationally."					
357	"2. Modifications should not impact on morbidity and mortality statistics, and should not conflict with the foundation."					
358	3. Approval of all national modifications will be subject to consideration of whether suitable additional detail already exists in the foundation.					
359	4. If a change is made to the international version of ICD-11 the respective national modification must incorporate the change as soon as possible.					
360	Example					
361	"‘Diabetes Type 1’ in the WHO version of ICD-11 is classifed to 5A10. A national modification may require additional detail to be added to the ICD-11 codes. For example, ‘Diabetes Type 1, uncontrolled’ could be added as a subcategory to 5A10, as 5A10.1 Diabetes Type 1, uncontrolled. However, when the mechanism of postcoordination provides the necessary detail, the addition of a new subcategory may not be necessary."					
362	2 Part 2 - Using ICD-11					
363	2.1 Basic coding and reporting guidelines					
364	"Coding is the assignment of one or more codes in order to represent the meaning of a condition in as much detail as required. Before attempting to code, the coder should be acquainted with the principles of classification and coding. In some instances, using one code will provide sufficient detail. In other instances, it may be necessary to use several codes together to express the level of detail required by the use case, setting, or laws."					
365	"For coding, it is recommended to use the ICD-11 Smart coding tool that can be used online and offline. It provides users with a simple automated way to find and select the needed categories. When the search shows a cluster of codes, rather than a single stem code, the tool can return the assembled cluster."					
366	"Software must not include lists or other prompts to guide the recording or coding, as these necessarily limit the range of diagnoses and therefore have an adverse effect on the accuracy and usefulness of the record and report."					
367	"There may be an alternative way, to use the print version of ICD-11 but this option is not recommended as its time consuming and may cause confusion in finding and selecting the correct codes or code combinations without the hints that the electronic coding tool provide. In case no electronic environment is available, specific solution can be sought in collaboration with WHO."					
368	"2.2 Tabular List, Special Tabulation Lists, Qualifiers, and Modifiers"					
369	"The Tabular list is an alphanumeric listing of diseases and disease groups, inclusion and exclusion notes, and some coding rules. Chapters 1 to 25 of the ICD contain approximately 15 000 entities at the four-, five- or six-character level."					
370	"In addition, there is a section on extension codes (2.9) and one on Traditional medicine (1.5). The Special tabulation lists are presented at the end of the Tabular list. Special tabulation lists are not designed for coding but are for tabulation and reporting only (2.25)."					
371	2.3 Index					
372	The Alphabetical Index is a list of more than 120 000 clinical terms (including synonyms or phrases). The index is used to find the relevant ICD codes or code combinations for clinical terms. The mention of a term in the index exclusively serves coding. Mention of a term in the index does not mean approval or endorsement of a particular condition.					
373	2.4 Reference Guide					
374	"The Reference Guide contains an introduction to the context, components, and intended use of the ICD. It describes the diverse components of ICD-11, provides guidance for certification, recording, rules for mortality coding (i.e. causes of death statistics) and morbidity coding (e.g. hospital statistics) and lists for tabulation of statistical data."					
375	2.5 Browser and coding tool					
376	"The WHO provides a browser and coding tool (‘blue browser’) for ICD–11 in multiple languages https://icd.who.int. This tool allows the user to retrieve concepts by searching for terms, anatomy or any other element found within the content of ICD-11 (see1.2.5 Foundation Component and Tabular lists of ICD–11)."					
377	"WHO also provides a maintenance platform (‘orange browser’), (see 3.12 Annex A: ICD-11 Updating and Maintenance). This tool allows the users to contribute to the updating and continuous improvement of ICD-11. Such input is submitted in the form of a proposal with a detailed rationale, scientific evidence and peer reviewed references to justify consideration for inclusion on an annual basis. (See 3.12 Annex A: ICD-11 Updating and Maintenance)."					
378	"For coding, the WHO provides the ICD-11 Smart coding tool, a simple automated way to find and select the needed categories."					
379	"ICD–11 can also be accessed using web services with user-specific software. The IT guide to the ICD provides more details on compatibility requirements. Both the web services and the online browser allow access to all Tabular lists of the ICD, for mortality and morbidity statistics, primary care, or for a specialty linearisation for use in certain specialised domains."					
380	2.6 Coding step by step – clinical term					
381	"The table below compares the coding steps in a paper and an electronic environment. The essential component of coding is finding a match to the reported clinical term – having a good dictionary in the relevant language, and verifying the resulting code against additional rules, are necessary. In an electronic environment programmatically embedded instructions can verify compliance with the coding rules."					
382	Electronic	Paper				
383	1. Enter the statement or term in the coding tool	1. Look up the lead term in the Alphabetical Index and applicable secondary terms.				
384	"2. Select the matching term, or the one closest to what you are looking for from amongst the displayed options"	"2. Select the appropriate term, or one closest to what you are looking for, from amongst the listed options"				
385	"3. Verify the result in the tabular list browser view for exclusions, inclusions and notes given at the level of that category, its grouping levels and at the chapter level."	"3. Verify the result in the tabular list (Volume 1) for exclusions, inclusions and notes given at the level of that category, its grouping levels and at the chapter level."				
386	The WHO online browser and coding tool are available at https://icd.who.int.					
387	2.7 ICD–11 conventions					
388	ICD–11 has standard ways of presenting its content. Conventions describe textual content and also apply to the coding structure.					
389	2.7.1 Inclusions					
390	"Within the coded categories there are typically other optional diagnostic terms. These are known as ‘inclusion terms’ and are given, in addition to the title, as examples of the diagnostic statements to be classified to that category. They may refer to different conditions or be synonyms. They are not a sub-classification of the category."					
391	"Inclusion terms are listed primarily as a guide to the content of the category, in addition to the descriptions. Many of the items listed relate to important or common terms belonging to the category. Others are borderline conditions or sites listed to distinguish the boundary between one subcategory and another. The lists of inclusion terms are by no means exhaustive."					
392	Alternative names of diagnostic entities (synonyms) are included and shown in the electronic coding tool and the Alphabetic Index.					
393	"It is sometimes necessary to read inclusion terms in conjunction with titles. This usually occurs when the inclusion terms describe lists of sites or pharmaceutical products, where appropriate words from the title (e.g. ‘malignant neoplasm of …’, ‘injury to …’, ‘toxic effects of …’) need to be understood. General diagnostic descriptions common to a range of categories, or to all the subcategories in a four-character category, are to be found in the notes heading ‘Inclusions’, immediately following a chapter, group, or category title."					
394	2.7.2 Exclusions					
395	Certain categories contain lists of conditions preceded by the word ‘Exclusions’. These are terms which are classified elsewhere. An example of this is 5A60 Hyperfunction of pituitary gland which excludes Cushing syndrome.					
396	Exclusions serve as a cross reference in ICD and help to delineate the boundaries of a category.					
397	"General exclusions for a range of categories or for all subcategories are found in the notes heading ‘Excludes’, immediately following a chapter, group or category title."					
398	Multiple parenting in ICD-11 shows categories in the context of siblings that are placed elsewhere in the classification. This is also an indication of an exclusion and means ‘a sibling is coded elsewhere’. In the print and the electronic version this is marked with the label ‘code elsewhere’.					
399	"2.7.2.1 ‘Code also’ and ‘Use additional code, if desired’ instructions"					
400	"‘Code also’ instructions inform the user about required additional aetiological information which is mandatory to be coded in a cluster with certain categories because that additional information is relevant for primary tabulation. The ‘code also’ statement marks the categories that must be used in conjunction with the indicated second code(s). However, in some instances aetiology may be unknown although the condition requires treatment in its own right. In this circumstance, the code may be reported alone."					
401	"For example, the category Diabetic cataract indicates ‘code also’ type of diabetes. This means that in conjunction with the code for ‘diabetic cataract’, the code for the type of diabetes should be assigned. Both stem codes for the type of diabetes and the diabetic cataract are always reported in a cluster."					
402	"‘Use additional code, if desired’ - instructions inform the user about optional additional detail that can be coded."					
403	2.7.3 ‘NEC’ and ‘NOS’					
404	2.7.3.1 ‘NEC’					
405	"The stem ‘not elsewhere classified’, when used in a category title, serve as a warning that certain specified variants of the listed conditions may appear in other parts of the classification. For example, NF09 Adverse effects, not elsewhere classified. Codes to which the NEC description is appended should only be used if one of the other options available in the classification is not suitable."					
406	2.7.3.2 ‘NOS’					
407	"The letters NOS are an abbreviation for the term ‘not otherwise specified’, implying that the documentation that is used for classifying does not provide more detail beyond the term provided. It implies ‘unspecified’, ‘incompletely specified’ or ‘unqualified’. Sometimes an unqualified term is nevertheless classified to a rubric for a more specific type of the condition. This is because, in medical terminology, the most common form of a condition is often known by the generic name of the condition itself and only the less common types are qualified. For example, ‘pharyngitis’ is commonly used to mean ‘acute pharyngitis’. These inbuilt assumptions have been taken into account in order to avoid incorrect classification."					
408	"Careful inspection of inclusion terms will reveal where an assumption of cause has been accounted for. Coders should be careful not to code a term as unqualified unless it is quite clear that no information is available that would permit a more specific assignment elsewhere. Similarly, in interpreting statistics based on the ICD, some conditions assigned to an apparently specified category will not have been so specified on the record that was coded. When comparing trends over time and interpreting statistics, it is important to be aware that assumptions may change from one revision of the ICD to another. For example, before the Eighth Revision, an unqualified aortic aneurysm was assumed to be due to syphilis (this is no longer the case since the introduction of ICD–10). In ICD-11 in most instances the ‘NOS’ terminology points to unspecified categories, so that future data analysis can take care of assumptions regarding the linguistic meaning."					
409	Additional terms permitted in ICD coding:					
410	Certain					
411	Other					
412	Unspecified					
413	And					
414	Or					
415	Due to					
416	With					
417	Caused by					
418	Attributed to					
419	Secondary to					
420	Associated with					
421	2.7.4 ‘Certain’					
422	"The term ‘certain’ is used where certain entities that could be grouped in a specific location in the classification are grouped somewhere else outside the current chapter or block. For example, 8B22 Certain specified cerebrovascular diseases means that only some specified cerebrovascular diseases are coded here, whereas other specific types of cerebrovascular disease are located elsewhere in the classification."					
423	2.7.5 Residual categories – ‘Other’ and ‘Unspecified’					
424	"ICD-11 coding should always be completed to include the most specific level of detail possible with the use of one code or multiple codes as described above. There are, however, circumstances when that is not possible and for that reason the ICD-11 includes categories titled ‘other’ and ‘unspecified’. In some instances, necessary information to select a specific category may not be available in the source documentation. When this is the case, the residual category ‘unspecified’ is selected. Conversely, there are instances where the information in the source documentation is very specific, but the tabular list does not include a specific category. In this case, users identify the closest category match, and code to the residual category titled ‘other’."					
425	2.7.6 Use of ‘And’ and ‘Or’					
426	"The words ‘and’ and ‘or’ in ICD–11 are used in their meaning in formal logic. A term that includes a statement of the kind ‘A and B’ means that both A and B, have to be present in order to use that category. A term that includes a statement of the kind ‘A or B’ means that the category may be used if either A or B are present."					
427	2.7.7 ‘Due to’ and ‘Associated with’					
428	"‘Due to’ is the preferred term for categories where two conditions are mentioned, and a causal sequence exists between them. Other terms, such as ‘caused by’ or ‘attributed to’ are allowable synonyms. The phrase ‘secondary to’ is equivalent and may also be included as a synonym. ‘Associated with’ is the preferred term for categories where two conditions are mentioned but there is no causal sequence implied."					
429	"2.7.8 Spelling, parentheses, grammar and other conventions"					
430	Spelling and grammar of ICD-11 follow the British rules with exceptions and amendments conforming to WHO spelling rules. The detailed conventions are listed below. The ICD-11 terminology uses the following conventions:					
431	"Terms are listed in their singular form. For example, ‘Superficial injury of scalp’ instead of ‘Superficial injuries of scalp’"					
432	"No use of apostrophes with eponyms. For example, ‘Hodgkin lymphoma’ (instead of ‘Hodgkin’s lymphoma’)"					
433	"Entities are described using natural language. For example, ‘myocardial infarction’ (instead of ‘infarction, myocardial’)."					
434	"Abbreviations are printed using upper case letters and followed by the complete title in full. For example, ‘MI – [myocardial infarction]’."					
435	"Parentheses are used in the tabular list to enclose the code to which an exclusion term refers. For example, 9A01.3 Infectious blepharitis Exclusions: Blepharoconjunctivitis (9A60.4)"					
436	2.7.9 General features					
437	The main structural innovation of ICD–11 is that it is built on a Foundation component from which the tabular lists (such as the classification for morbidity and mortality statistics) is derived. See 1.2.5 Foundation Component and Tabular lists of ICD–11.					
438	Table 1: ICD-11 Terminology					
439	ICD-11 Term	Explanation				
440	Foundation component	"Underlying data base content that holds all necessary information to generate print versions of the tabular list and the alphabetical index, as well as additional information that is needed to generate specialty linearisations of ICD-11 and country specific modifications."				
441	Stem code	"Stem codes are codes that can be used alone. They are found in the tabular list of ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics. Stem codes may be entities or groupings of high relevance, or clinical conditions that should always be described as one single category. The design of stem codes makes sure that in use cases that require only one code per case, a meaningful minimum of information is collected."				
442	Extension code	"Extension codes are lists of additional information that can be is added to a stem code when users and settings are interested in reporting more detail. Extension codes are not mutually exclusive. They are not designed to be a classification but may show hierarchies and can never be used without a stem code in the context of statistical classification. Extension codes can never appear in the first position in a cluster. Extension codes may be used alone in another context, e.g. for device documentation."				
443	Precoordination	"Stem codes may contain all pertinent information about a clinical concept in a pre-combined fashion. This is referred to as ‘precoordination’.
Example: BD50.40 Abdominal aortic aneurysm with perforation
Example: CA40.04 Pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae"				
444	Postcoordination	"The use of multiple codes (i.e. stem codes and/or extension codes) together to fully describe a documented clinical concept. Postcoordination is by matter of principle permitted with all axes, as long as at least one stem code is used. API, Browser and coding tool facilitate postcoordination in certain areas. Other areas of postcoordination have to be coded individually, but may be supported by future updates of ICD-11, where need arises."				
445	Cluster	"A cluster is the postcoordinated entities that are joined using either a forward slash (/) or ampersand (&).
Example:
Diagnosis: Duodenal ulcer with acute haemorrhage
Cluster: DA63.Z/ME24.90
Condition - DA63 Duodenal ulcer, unspecified
Has manifestation (use additional code, if desired) - ME24.90 Acute gastrointestinal bleeding, not elsewhere classified"				
446	Primary and secondary parents	"The hierarchy of ICD-11 is defined the same as it was in previous versions of ICD. The ability to connect specific diseases and concepts within the classification to another parent code was introduced to enable specific extracts of the Tabular list for medical specialties or for specific use cases.
Example: A code for a malignant neoplasm of the skin is in the chapter for malignant neoplasms. The primary parent for this code is a code or a block from this chapter. However, a medical doctor treating only skin diseases might want to see only codes from the classification that are relevant for his or her specific clinical purpose. Therefore, a secondary parent was defined in the skin chapter which will only show the code in this chapter if the specific extract of codes for his or her use case is selected."				
447	2.8 Stem codes					
448	"ICD–11 stem codes are codes in a particular tabular list that can be used alone. Stem codes may be entities or groupings of high relevance, or clinical entities that should always be described as one entity. The design of stem codes makes sure that in use cases that require only one code per case a meaningful minimum of information is collected."					
449	"The stem codes of the ICD-11 are organised in 26 chapters that follow the traditional pattern of the ICD, relating to aetiology, relevant organ system, maternal status, perinatal status, external causes, and factors influencing health status."					
450	2.9 Extension codes					
451	"Extension codes are provided for use as supplementary or additional codes when it is desired to identify more detail in classification entities elsewhere. The inclusion of the new Extension codes in ICD–11 provides capacity for coding qualifying information and are linked to stem codes. Extension codes have been designed to standardise the way additional information is added to stem codes, and the adoption of multi-dimensional coding results in a substantially reduced amount of stem codes. Extension codes may be used alone in other contexts, e.g. device documentation."					
452	Extension codes are not mutually exclusive. They are not a classification and can never be used without a stem code for statistical purposes. Extension codes can never appear in the first position in a classification cluster. One or more extension codes can be linked when coding a specific condition.					
453	There are two main types of Extension codes:					
454	"Type 1 extension codes allow the user to add detail to a stem code in terms of severity, temporality, anatomy, histopathology of the condition or other dimensions like substances and medical devices. For example, if the diagnostic statement reads ‘cervical disc prolapse C5-C6’ the anatomy extension code XA1X49 Cervical intervertebral disc or space C5-C6 can be added to the stem code FA80.1 Intervertebral disc degeneration of cervical spine with prolapsed disc in order to capture the detail of contained in the diagnostic statement."					
455	"Type 2 extension codes represent diagnosis code descriptors which indicate how the diagnosis is to be used and/or interpreted. The meaning of the code refers to the same condition, but the use of type 2 – diagnosis code descriptor extension code alters its interpretation. For example, for adverse event reporting it is important to code diagnosis timing in terms of XY6M Present on admission, XY69 Developed after admission, or XY85 Uncertain timing of onset relative to admission."					
456	Overview of the Type 1 Extension codes					
457	Severity scale value					
458	Temporality (course of the condition)					
459	Aetiology					
460	Topology Scale Value					
461	Anatomy and topography					
462	Histopathology					
463	Dimensions of injury					
464	Dimensions of external causes					
465	Consciousness					
466	Substances					
467	ICD-O					
468	"Health Devices, Equipment and Supplies"					
469	Overview of Type 2 – Extension codes - Diagnosis Code Descriptors					
470	Discharge diagnosis types					
471	Diagnosis timing					
472	Diagnosis timing in relation to surgical procedure					
473	Diagnosis method of confirmation					
474	Diagnosis certainty					
475	Obstetrical diagnosis timing					
476	Encounter descriptors					
477	Capacity or context					
478	2.10 Precoordination and postcoordination					
479	Some stem codes contain all pertinent information about a clinical concept in a pre-combined fashion. This is referred to as ‘precoordination’.					
480	"A health condition may be further described to any level of detail, by applying more than one code, or by ‘postcoordinating’ (i.e. combining codes):"					
481	"two or more stem codes, (i.e. code1/code2)"					
482	stem codes with one or more extension codes. (i.e. stem code&extension code1&extension code2)					
483	"A group of codes that have been postcoordinated is called a ‘cluster’. A forward slash (/) or ampersand (&) is used to show the linkage between postcoordinated codes. In this manner, the classification can address many clinical concepts with a limited range of categories."					
484	Example					
485	"Precoordination of concepts in a single code Condition: 2C25.2 Squamous cell carcinoma of bronchus or lung has precoordination, both site and pathology are combined in a single precoordinated stem code."					
486	Example					
487	"Postcoordination of concepts combined in a cluster: the condition urinary tract infection due to Extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli’ is expressed through a combination of two linked or postcoordinated stem codes. Condition: GC08.0 Urinary tract infection, site not specified, due to Escherichia coli Associated with (use additional code, if desired): MG50.27 Extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli Cluster code: GC08.0/MG50.27"					
488	Postcoordination axis	Description				
489	‘Has causing condition’ - this field is indicating the causing condition that must be coded when known. The causing condition can be compared to the ‘dagger’ code in ICD-10. This option is found at entities that are typically caused by a range of different conditions and is referred to as mandatory postcoordination in the Coding tool.	"It is mandatory to code the causing condition for primary tabulation when it is known. ‘Has causing condition’ is added to categories that are caused by an underlying disease. For example, retinopathy has a ‘causing condition’ of diabetes. Causing conditions should be considered required in almost all situations, and must be used for conditions that are manifestations."				
490	‘Has manifestation’ - prompts the user to code any manifestations. Manifestations can be compared to the ‘asterisk’ codes in ICD-10. This option is found at entities that can develop manifestations.	"It is optional to code manifestations of a disease. For example, diabetes ‘Has manifestations’ such as retinopathy. This coding should be considered ‘Allowed’ in almost all situations. The listed manifestations are usually a sample of the ones frequently resulting from the condition."				
491	‘Associated with’ - when conditions are captured together for a full picture but do not necessarily represent a cause and effect scenario.	"This field is used when multiple codes are required to fully describe a condition. For example, ‘Associated with’ is used to link the codes for antimicrobial resistance to the codes for the infection. This coding can be either ‘Allowed’ or ‘Required’ depending on the situation."				
492	Special cases for postcoordination:					
493	1. External cause codes are ‘allowed’ to identify the cause of an injury and are ‘associated with’ the injuries.					
494	2. The external cause code to identify a specific drug is ‘allowed’ with entities beginning with or including the phrase ‘Drug -induced’.					
495	3. External cause codes for the mode and mechanism of health care related harm are ‘associated with’ the codes for the harm.					
496	2.10.1 Adding detail – postcoordination and cluster coding with multiple stem codes and extension codes					
497	"Information about the aetiology and the manifestation of the condition of interest should be coded. In some instances, the ICD category refers to both (i.e. precoordinated), while in other instances more than one stem code (and/or extension code) needs to be used in order to express the relevant detail. This requires postcoordination."					
498	E.g. Acute bleeding duodenal ulcer					
499	"Stem Code: DA63.Z Duodenal ulcer, unspecified Has manifestation (use additional code, if desired): ME24.90 Acute gastrointestinal bleeding, not elsewhere classified Cluster: DA63.Z/ME24.90"					
500	"However, postcoordination must never be used to replicate the meaning of a condition that is a precoordinated concept. The precoordinated code should be used."					
501	E.g. Acute RSV bronchiolitis					
502	"Code: CA41.0 Acute bronchiolitis due to respiratory syncytial virus Explanation: Since RSV bronchiolitis is a precoordinated concept in ICD-11, it is incorrect/prohibited to replicate the meaning of the diagnostic statement using a stem code and extension code (i.e. do not code: [CA41.Z] Acute bronchiolitis, unspecified&XN275 Human respiratory syncytial virus)"					
503	"E.g. Fracture, shaft of ulna"					
504	"Code: NC32.2 Fracture of shaft of ulna Explanation: Since fracture of shaft of ulna is a precoordinated concept in ICD-11, it is incorrect/prohibited to replicate the meaning of the diagnostic statement using a stem code and extension code (i.e. do not code: NC32.Z Fracture of forearm, unspecified&XA8U33 shaft of the ulna)"					
505	"There may be less obvious cases across the ICD. In an electronic environment, programmatically embedded instructions will help to avoid this kind of mistake. For reporting purposes, any correlated codes are linked using a forward slash (/) between stem codes and an ampersand (&) to separate stem codes with extension codes."					
506	"2.10.2 Combining stem codes and extension codes, and how to order these in a complex code cluster"					
507	Stem codes from other parts of ICD and extension codes can be linked together to describe a clinical concept in detail. They have to be grouped together in data transmission and evaluation in order to not lose the information conveyed by the joint group of codes. Such a group of codes is called a cluster. Cluster coding requires use of a specific syntax to indicate which codes belong together when postcoordination is used. This syntax has to comply with the following rules:					
508	"1. If only one stem code is coded, no clustering mechanisms need to be observed."					
509	E.g. Condition: Acute ST elevation myocardial infarction BA41.0 Acute ST elevation myocardial infarction					
510	"2. When postcoordinating to form a cluster, stem codes are always coded before extension codes. (Note, however, the complex clustering scenario depicted in Example 5 below, where a combination of multiple stem codes and linked extension codes are combined in a single complex cluster)."					
511	"3. If one stem code is postcoordinated with one or more extension codes, the combining syntax used is the ampersand (&)."					
512	"Example 1: Acute ST elevation myocardial infarction, anterior wall, LAD"					
513	"Condition (code) - Acute ST elevation myocardial infarction BA41.0 Acute ST elevation myocardial infarction Specific anatomy - XA7RE3 Anterior wall of heart
Specific anatomy - XA7NQ7 Left anterior descending coronary artery Cluster: BA41.0&XA7RE3&XA7NQ7"					
514	"Example 2: Acute pyelonephritis, left side, E. coli Condition (code) - GB51 Acute pyelonephritis"					
515	Laterality - XK8G Left Infectious agent - XN6P4 Escherichia coli Cluster: GB51&XK8G&XN6P4					
516	"4. If two stem codes are postcoordinated to provide additional detail, it is important to follow the order (within a cluster) according to the use case (e.g. mortality or morbidity). The first stem code will be separated from the second stem code by a slash (/)."					
517	"If only one code can be retained during data analysis for mortality (underlying cause of death) and public health prevention, priority of order should be given to the code that best describes the aetiology of a condition. If only one code can be retained for morbidity data analysis, priority should be given to the main condition (reason for admission after study established at the end of the episode of health care)."					
518	Example 3: Mortality (underlying cause of death) code ordering within a cluster					
519	Patient died because of their diabetic coma. The patient had Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Condition (terminal cause of death): 5A23 Diabetic coma Condition (underlying cause of death): 5A11 Type 2 diabetes mellitus Mortality cluster order: 5A11/5A23					
520	Example 4: Morbidity (main condition) code ordering within a cluster (if only one code can be retained during data analysis)					
521	Patient admitted to hospital in a diabetic coma. The patient had Type 2 diabetes mellitus.					
522	Main condition: 5A23 Diabetic coma Other condition: 5A11 Type 2 diabetes mellitus Morbidity cluster order: 5A23/5A11					
523	"5. If a stem code is postcoordinated with extension codes and another stem code with some more extension codes is also coded within a cluster, the specific syntax should be designed to make a clear distinction between which extension codes in the cluster belong to which stem codes. The following syntax must be followed: The first stem code is reported, followed by an ‘&’ followed by one or more extension codes, each of them separated by ‘&’. Then a slash ‘/’ separates this first section of the cluster from the next stem code which is followed by ‘&’ and the extension codes for this specific stem code, each again separated by ‘&’."					
524	Example 5: stem code & extension code / stem code & extension code & extension code					
525	"Left inguinal hernia with acute obstruction Condition (code) - DD51 Inguinal hernia
Laterality - XK8G Left"					
526	"Associated with (use additional code, if desired) - ME24.2 Digestive system obstruction"					
527	Course - XT5R Acute Cluster: DD51&XK8G/ME24.2&XT5R					
528	"Postcoordination is only to be used to combine codes to describe and fully characterise a documented clinical concept. If the documentation describes two distinct clinical concepts that are represented by separate stem codes, they should not be reported together in a postcoordinated cluster."					
529	Example 6: Pedestrian fall injury					
530	Concussion and open fracture shaft of left ulna due to fall on uneven sidewalk:					
531	Condition (code) 1 - NA07.0 Concussion					
532	Has causing condition (code also) - PA60 Unintentional fall on the same level or from less than 1 metre					
533	"Objects of living things involved in causing - XE1DA Uneven surface, not elsewhere classified"					
534	Place of occurrence - XE53A Sidewalk Cluster - NA07.0/ PA60& XE1DA&XE53A					
535	Condition (code) 2 - NC32.2 Fracture of shaft of ulna					
536	Laterality - XK8G Left					
537	Fracture open or closed - XJ7YM Open fracture					
538	"Associated with: PA60 Unintentional fall on the same level or from less than 1 metre
Objects of living things involved in causing - XE1DA Uneven surface, not elsewhere classified"					
539	Place of occurrence - XE53A Sidewalk Cluster: NC32.2 & XK8G& XJ7YM /PA60 & XE1DA & XE53A					
540	"Programmatically embedded instructions in the Foundation component of ICD-11 facilitate use of frequently used code combinations. Code combinations are not limited to the ones facilitated by these instructions. Additional instructions are added, based on user demands."					
541	2.10.3 Diagnosis Timing - ‘Present on admission’ vs. ‘Developed after admission’					
542	"Among the new Type 2 -Diagnosis Code Descriptors is the particularly important set of extension codes that allow for distinction of diagnoses present on admission from diagnoses arising after admission, i.e. during the period of hospitalisation."					
543	"The latter distinction is particularly important, because it allows for the targeted identification of a number of in-hospital diagnoses that may represent adverse events associated with health care. The majority of coded concepts in a hospital record are conditions present on admission. Recognising this, it will be of significant interest to flag a diagnosis that developed after admission."					
544	Example 1:					
545	"A patient with long-standing type 1 diabetes, admitted to hospital because of a myocardial infarction."					
546	Main condition: Myocardial infarction					
547	"Other condition: Diabetes mellitus, type 1"					
548	"In this instance, both conditions are present at admission, but one of them (myocardial infarction) does not need to be coded as being ‘present on admission’ because it is the main condition, designated in this example as being ‘the condition that is determined to be the reason for admission, established at the end of the episode of health care’. The appropriate coding of this scenario therefore includes a combination of two clustered coding entities, each of which involves a stem code linked to an accompanying extension code i.e.:"					
549	‘Stem code for acute myocardial infarction’&‘Discharge Diagnosis Type Extension code for reason for main condition’; BA41&XY0Y					
550	‘Stem code for diabetes mellitus type 1’&‘Diagnosis timing Extension code for present on admission’; 5A10&XY6M					
551	"Note that for both coded entities in the above example, an ampersand (&) is used. In the first cluster, the stem code for myocardial infarction is linked to a diagnosis type extension code for main condition diagnosis type. In the second cluster, the stem code for diabetes mellitus type 1 is linked to a diagnosis timing extension code for present on admission."					
552	Example 2:					
553	"A patient with long-standing type 1 diabetes, admitted to hospital because of chest pain. After assessment diagnosed with myocardial infarction. The patient develops deep vein thrombosis in right lower limb as an in-hospital complication of care."					
554	Main condition: Myocardial infarction					
555	"Other conditions: Diabetes mellitus, type 1; Deep vein thrombosis (arising after hospital stay began)"					
556	"In this example, a diagnosis timing extension code for ‘developed after admission’ is linked by cluster coding to a stem code for ‘deep vein thrombosis’. The first two diagnostic concepts, meanwhile, are coded exactly as per the preceding example. i.e."					
557	‘Stem code for acute myocardial infarction’&‘Discharge Diagnosis Type Extension code for main condition’; BA41&XY0Y					
558	‘Stem code for diabetes mellitus type 1’&‘Diagnosis Timing Extension code for present on admission’; 5A10&XY6M					
559	‘Stem code for deep vein thrombosis’&‘Right’&‘Diagnosis Timing Extension code for developed after admission’; BD71.4&XK9K&XY69					
560	"Again, each of the three cluster entities uses an ampersand ‘&’ because the second code (and third code) in the cluster is an extension code."					
561	2.11 Functioning section					
562	"The Functioning section of ICD-11 allows coding and assessment of functioning in line with ICF but at an operational level. For detailed recording and assessment, the full ICF should be used. This section’s concepts are aligned with ICF and allow an easy transition to ICF. The design of the functioning section in ICD-11 addresses documentation and assessment of the level of functioning of persons, for"					
563	"general medical practice, as work incapacity assessment"					
564	"social benefits as for disability, or accident pension"					
565	payment or reimbursement purposes					
566	"needs assessment as in rehabilitation, occupational assistance, or long term care"					
567	outcome evaluation of treatment					
568	The functioning section in ICD-11 provides clinician-friendly tools for standardized assessment and documentation of functioning. The functioning section of ICD-11 allows for adding future additional assessment instruments.					
569	2.11.1 Functioning assessment					
570	2.11.1.1 WHO DAS 2.0: features and use cases					
571	"The WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS 2.0) is the internationally, culturally and socioeconomically validated generic functioning assessment instrument for an adult population. WHO DAS 2.0 is focused on ICF Activity and Participation domains and allows to compute an overall and domain specific functioning score covering the following domains:"					
572	Cognition – understanding & communicating					
573	Mobility– moving & getting around					
574	"Self-care– hygiene, dressing, eating & staying alone"					
575	Getting along– interacting with other people					
576	"Life activities– domestic responsibilities, leisure, work & school"					
577	"Participation – joining in community activities, participating in society"					
578	"WHO DAS scoring takes into account multiple levels of difficulty for each WHODAS 2.0 item (i.e. IRT based scoring). This type of scoring for WHODAS 2.0 allows for more fine-grained analyses that make use of the full information of the response categories for comparative analysis across populations or subpopulations. It takes the coding for each item response as “none”, “mild”, “moderate”, “severe” and “extreme” separately, and then uses a computation to determine the summary score by differentially weighting the items and the levels of severity."					
579	The scoring has three steps:					
580	Step 1 – Summing of recoded item scores within each domain.					
581	Step 2 – Summing of all six domain scores.					
582	Step 3 – Converting the summary score into a metric ranging from 0 to 100 (where 0 = no disability; 100 = full disability).					
583	The WHO DAS 2.0 scoring syntax is listed online via the link shared below.					
584	Key features of WHO-DAS 2.0 include:					
585	"ICF derived clinical scale with well-established psychometric properties of validity, reliability and sensitivity to change over time."					
586	Cardinal measure which is applicable across all health conditions and allows to generate an overall and domain specific functioning scores.					
587	Established population norms.					
588	The combination of this features sets WHO DAS 2.0 apart from other clinical instruments.					
589	WHO DAS 2.0 can be used for assessment of functioning in multiple use cases:					
590	Clinicians can quantify the effectiveness of their intervention within their clinical population and with reference to the general population.					
591	"Disability evaluators can determine disability status in fair, transparent, impartial and comparable way."					
592	Reimbursement experts can measure quality (functioning outcome) of Case-mix/DRG groups.					
593	WHO DAS 2.0 has been developed for use in adult population and currently does not assess body impairments or environmental factors. Users who wish to asses impairments in body functions and can make use of the WHO Model Disability Survey (MDS)[1] items which are also included in the function assessment part of the V Chapter.					
594	"WHO DAS 2.0 versions in three different formats (i.e. clinician administered, self-administered and proxy-administered) can be found via the link below."					
595	"WHO DAS 2.0 manual provides practical guidance for administering and scoring WHO DAS 2.0. including information on the simple and complex (Item-Response-Theory, IRT) scoring algorithm and population norms for the WHO DAS 12 and 36 item version. The WHO DAS 2.0 manual can be downloaded from the WHO website link - WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS 2.0) '- https://www.who.int/standards/classifications/international-classification-of-functioning-disability-and-health/who-disability-assessment-schedule together with other languages version of the WHO DAS 2.0."					
596	[1] The MDS is a ICF based general population survey developed by WHO and the World Bank that provides detailed and nuanced information on the lives of people with disability. It allows direct comparison between groups with differing levels and profiles of disability.					
597	2.11.1.2 WHO DAS 2.0: representation and coding structure					
598	"To enable easy information retrieval each WHO DAS 2.0 item has an assigned alphanumeric code to represent the captured concepts of the respective item. The code starts with the letters “VD” followed by a randomly assign number. Additional item specific information and values (i.e. item question, five-point response scale) are included in the ICD-11 APIs to allow for easy integration of the instrument and the automated scoring computation in any software application (e.g. integration of WHO DAS 2.0 as health outcome measure in EMR software). The six WHO DAS 2.0 domains under which the 36 items of the instrument are grouped are represented as block heading. Like other ICD-11 block headings they are assigned an URI but not a code. Table 1 below shows an example of how a WHO DAS 2.0 item are represented."					
599	WHO DAS 2.0 item	ICD-11 Code	URI			
600	Attention functions	VD00	http://id.who.int/icd/entity/532448599			
601	Item description question	Item response scale value set	Mapped ICF category			
602	"Because of your health condition, in the past 30 days, how much difficulty did you have in concentrating on doing something for ten minutes?"	"1=no difficulty, 2=mild difficulty, 3=moderate difficulty, 4=severe difficulty, 5=complete difficulty"	d160 Focusing attention			
603	2.11.2 Generic functioning entity					
604	2.11.2.1 Functioning entities: features and use cases					
605	The main tool for documenting functioning is a list of generic functioning domains derived from the ICF Annex 9 and the ICF generic core set.					
606	The generic list allows clinicians to generate a coded functioning profile of an individual which can be used for multiple purposes like - goal setting - monitoring change - communicating across the continuum of care.					
607	"Because the list is directly linked to the ICF, it may - Facilitate joint use of ICD & ICF (code once – use multiple times) - Serve as an entry point the use of the full ICF."					
608	2.11.2.2 Functioning entity: representation and coding structure					
609	In accordance with the WHO FIC content model a functioning entity has two components i.e. category and a qualifier. Both have an assigned alphanumeric code and an URI to represent the captured concepts. The code starts with the letters “VV” followed by a randomly assign number. The functioning category and the qualifier are linked through postcoordination.					
610	2.12 Electronic recording and reporting					
611	Electronic documentation will follow the principle of lossless collection of information at the source. Best practice includes reporting of:					
612	"1. A text field that captures the clinical term or cause of death with the exact wording reported by the health provider, and"					
613	"2. A data field that retains the identifier (URI) of the chosen entity of ICD-11 (index, code title or other element) that represents the most exact match for that text."					
614	3. A data field for the relevant ICD-11 code.					
615	"In this way, the quality of the coding can be verified at any point in time. Also, specific conditions can be identified and analysed, independently of them being linked to an individual ICD code or lumped together in a code with other conditions."					
616	"Coding shall be done using tools based on the ICD-11 API, like the ICD-11 coding tool. Software must not include lists or other prompts to guide the recording or coding, as these necessarily limit the range of diagnoses and therefore have negative impact on the accuracy and usefulness of the record and report."					
617	2.13 Foundation Component and Tabular lists					
618	"The Foundation Component is a multi-dimensional collection of all ICD entities. Entities can be diseases, disorders, injuries, external causes, signs and symptoms. Some entities may be very broad, for example ‘injury of the arm’, while others are more detailed, for example ‘laceration of the skin of the thumb’. The Foundation Component also has the necessary information to use the entities to build a tabular list. The Foundation Component includes information on where and how a certain entity is represented in a tabular list, whether it becomes a grouping, a category with a stem code, or whether it is mentioned as an inclusion term in a particular category."					
619	"Several different tabular lists can be built from the Foundation Component. Drawing on the same Foundation Component, a set of tabular lists that builds on the same hierarchical tree structure can be created – producing congruent tabular lists. The Foundation Component includes instructions on how to combine certain codes in a tabular list to achieve more detail in coding. These rules help coders and computer systems to visualise the permitted code combinations when they are using a tabular list."					
620	Core tabular lists for international use:					
621	Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (MMS)					
622	Primary care low resources settings (PCL)					
623	Verbal Autopsy (VA)					
624	Startup Mortality List (SMoL)					
625	"The full name of such a tabular list will always include ‘ICD–11’, e.g. ICD–11 MMS."					
626	"In a Tabular list, entities of the Foundation Component become categories. The categories are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive and linked to a mono hierarchical tree (they have only one parent). The information related to an entity that has become a category and has multiple parents is still available from the Foundation. This information can be used to visualise that category in more than one place in the Tabular list, e.g. showing them in black in its place for reference tabulation and in grey in any other place for browsing or alternative tabulations. ICD–11 has multiple congruent tabular lists with varying levels of detail."					
627	"The Foundation Component is also the data source for production and maintenance of Tabular lists, index and the Reference Guide. It also includes additional content (see ‘content model’) that goes beyond the traditional paper-based use of a classification. Depending on the setting within a country, it may be decided to use the full Foundation Component or to focus on the parts that are essential to production and maintenance of the Index and the Tabular list."					
628	"The Foundation Component serves to align the content of the different tabular lists and to define their categories. As such it allows standardised use of the ICD-11, independent of the setting in which it is used. The Foundation Component includes, for example, links to other classifications or terminologies that can be expanded in the future. Only if relevant for a country is this information, or subsets of it, used in the application of ICD-11. Please note that the mention of a term or entity in the Foundation exclusively serves ontological purposes. Mention of a term or entity in the Foundation does not mean approval or endorsement of a particular condition."					
629	2.14 Main uses of the ICD: Mortality					
630	"This section concerns the rules and guidelines adopted by the World Health Assembly regarding the selection of a single cause or condition for routine tabulation from death certificates. Guidelines are also provided for the application of the rules and for coding of the condition selected for tabulation. Implementation of the ICD for mortality requires setting up an infrastructure for reporting and storing information, designing information flows, quality assurance and feedback, and training for classification users working with the input or output of data."					
631	"Following the introductory information in this Section and 2.15, Section 2.16 explains the basic concepts used in mortality coding. Sections 2.17 - 2.20, supplemented by Annexes in Section 3.14, guides how to code and identify the underlying cause of death, and Section 2.25 explains descriptions used in statistical tabulation and international reporting for mortality."					
632	2.15 Mortality statistics					
633	"Mortality statistics are widely used for medical research, monitoring of public health, evaluating health interventions, allocation of health resources and planning and for, and follow-up of health care. Analysis of mortality data typically involves comparisons of data sets, for example those representing different geographical regions or different points in time. Unless the data have been produced by the same methods and according to the same standards, such comparisons will yield misleading results."					
634	"To standardise production of mortality data, WHO issues international instructions on data collection, coding and classification, and statistical presentation of causes of death. It is of utmost importance that production of mortality data follows the procedures detailed next, since any deviation from the international instructions will impair international comparability. The description of a single underlying cause of death, and selected approaches to capture further information on causes of death also reported on a certificate, enables the identification of trends in health for a given population. The following sections contain information on coding causes of death for mortality statistics. They explain the basic concepts, how to code conditions reported on death certificates, and how to select and tabulate the underlying cause of death."					
635	"The aim of these instructions is to optimise the mortality statistics from a public health point of view. Some of the instructions may appear wrong or questionable from a purely medical perspective. They should still not be set aside, since they may be motivated by well-founded epidemiological and public health principles. If an apparent error is found, it should be reported to WHO through the online proposal mechanism. WHO will either explain the rationale or take steps to correct the error at the international level. Individual countries should not correct what is assumed to be an error, since changes at the national level will lead to data that are less comparable to data from other countries, and thus less useful for analysis"					
636	2.15.1 What is tabulated: Underlying cause of death					
637	"Effective public health interventions prevent harm or death by breaking the chain of events that lead to harm. For this purpose, the underlying cause of death has been defined as ‘(a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of morbid events leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury’, and is selected for routine single-cause tabulation of mortality statistics. See Sections 2.17.2 Selecting the underlying cause of death and 2.17 Coding instructions for mortality for specific coding instructions to identify the underlying cause of death."					
638	2.15.2 Data source: The international form of Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD)					
639	"The international mortality coding instructions presuppose that data have been collected with a death certificate conforming to the international form of Medical Certificate of Cause of Death as recommended by the WHO. Frame A, the medical data part of the international form is split into two parts: Part 1 is for diseases related to the chain of events directly leading to death, and Part 2 is for other significant conditions contributing to death. Other information in the form is also used in identifying the underlying cause of death for tabulation."					
640	"In order to align the way this information is collected internationally, the form should be followed as closely as possible. Otherwise, the causes of death cannot be coded and selected according to the international standard and the data will not be internationally comparable. For example, some coding instructions apply to conditions reported as caused by certain other conditions, and in such cases, it is important to have a clear distinction between causes reported in Part 1 and in Part 2 of the death certificate. Further, information reported elsewhere on the certificate, such as manner of death or whether pregnancy contributed to the death, is essential when assigning multiple cause codes to the conditions stated on the certificate and selecting an underlying cause for tabulation."					
641	"It is the responsibility of the medical practitioner or other qualified certifier signing the death certificate to indicate which morbid conditions led directly to death and to state any pre-existing conditions giving rise to this cause. The certifier should use his or her clinical judgement in completing the medical certificate of cause of death. Automated systems must not include lists or other prompts to guide the certifier, as these necessarily limit the range of diagnoses and therefore have an adverse effect on the accuracy and usefulness of the report."					
642	The 2016 International form of the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death					
643	See 3.14 Annex C: Annexes for Mortality Coding for further details and guidance.					
644	2.15.3 Routine use and special cases					
645	2.15.3.1 Routine cause of death reporting systems					
646	"In routine cause of death reporting systems, every individual death is certified by a qualified medical doctor who carries out an accurate postmortem examination, collects history from relatives, and has access to all pre-existing medical information about the defunct. The medical certification of the cause of death is usually the responsibility of the attending physician and should be in line with international recommendations. Administrative procedures should ensure confidentiality of data from death certificates or other medical records."					
647	"In the case of deaths certified by coroners or other legal authorities, the medical evidence supplied to the certifier should be stated on the certificate in addition to any legal findings."					
648	Routine cause of death reporting is usually embedded in the certification of death process. Death certificates are a legal requirement for burial and for inheritance.					
649	2.15.3.2 Verbal autopsy					
650	"Verbal autopsy (VA) is a method used to ascertain the cause of a death based on an interview with next of kin or other caregivers where no medical certification is available. This is done using a standardised instrument that elicits information on signs, symptoms, medical history, and circumstances preceding death. The cause of death, or the sequence of causes that led to death, are assigned based on the data collected by the instrument and other available information. Rules and guidelines, algorithms or computer programs, may assist in evaluating the information to determine the cause of death."					
651	"The main objective of the VA is to describe the causes of death at the community or population level in areas, where civil registration and death certification systems are weak and where most people die at home without having had contact with the health system. A standard VA instrument comprises a VA questionnaire, cause of death or mortality classification system, and diagnostic criteria (either expert or data derived algorithms) for deriving causes of death."					
652	"The VA process consists of interviews, data recording, and identification of the cause of death from the reports. At any step, factors can influence the cause-specific mortality fractions estimated throughout the process. Besides research, VA is a viable method for causes of death identification in settings where no physician can evaluate the deceased. More information can be found on the WHO Verbal autopsy webpage[2]."

654	2.16 Basic concepts					
655	Mortality coders must be familiar with the basic concepts introduced in this section.					
656	Basic Concepts					
657	Basic concepts for mortality coding in the international form of the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death					
658	2.16.1 Terminal cause of death					
659	The disease or condition entered first on the first used line of Part 1 of the death certificate is the cause directly leading to death. This is known as the terminal or immediate cause of death.					
660	"Example 1			
1	(a)	Myocardial infarction
due to
(b)	Coronary atherosclerosis
due to
(c)	
due to
(d)	
2		"					
661	"The myocardial infarction is the terminal cause of death, since it is entered first on the first used line of the certificate."					
662	"Example 2			
1	(a)	Myocardial infarction and pulmonary oedema

(d)	
2		"					
663	"The myocardial infarction is the terminal cause of death, since it is entered first on the first used line of the certificate."					
664	2.16.2 Causal relationship and sequence					
665	"A causal relationship exists if a condition mentioned on the death certificate can be caused by another condition also mentioned on the certificate. The term ‘sequence’ refers to a chain or series of medical events in which each step is a complication of, or is caused by, the previous step. A causal relationship can exist between any two conditions, including conditions assigned to the same ICD-11 code, regardless of where each condition was reported. In a correctly completed death certificate, a sequence is a set of conditions reported line by line with a causal relationship between each element. Four lines are provided in Part 1 of the certificate for recording the sequence of events leading to the death. A certifier may only use as many lines as are required to describe the sequence."					
666	"A causal relationship is considered acceptable for mortality coding if it is founded not only on a medical assessment but also on epidemiological and public health considerations. Therefore, a medically acceptable relationship might be listed as unacceptable in the coding instructions because a later step in the sequence is more important from a public health point of view."					
667	"In addition, a reported sequence that appears improbable should be accepted if one or more intervening steps would explain the causal relationship, even if these have not been reported. However, such assumed intervening causes are not to be coded, as they are assumptions and not reported conditions."					
668	"To decide whether a stated causal relationship is acceptable, always apply the instructions in Section 2.19.1 Special instructions on accepted and rejected sequences (Steps SP3 and SP4). Stated relationships that are not listed in Section 2.19.1 should be accepted as far as possible, because the certifier’s opinion about the causes leading to death should not be disregarded."

670	"The terminal cause of death is myocardial infarction. It is caused by the coronary thrombosis, which, in turn, is caused by coronary atherosclerosis. Consequently, the sequence is: myocardial infarction due to coronary thrombosis due to coronary atherosclerosis."

672	"The terminal cause of death is haemorrhage. It is a complication of the traumatic amputation of the right leg, which, in turn, is caused by the bus accident. Consequently, the sequence is: extensive haemorrhage due to traumatic amputation of the right leg due to being run over by a bus."					
673	2.16.3 Starting point					
674	"The starting point is the condition or event that started the sequence of acceptable causal relationships ending with the terminal cause of death. In a correctly completed death certificate, the condition reported first on the lowest used line in Part 1 is the starting point of the sequence. The instructions on how to identify the starting point is provided in Section 2.17.3 Find the starting point (Steps SP1 to SP8)."					
675	"If the death certificate is not correctly filled out, the starting point may be reported elsewhere, and instructions are given to identify the starting point also for such cases in a standardised manner. Therefore, it is important to apply the instructions in Section 2.17.3 in a sequential manner."					
676	The condition provisionally considered as the starting point when applying the instructions step by step is referred to as the ‘tentative starting point (TSP)’ and may change several times as the instructions are applied to the death certificate.

680	"Tripped on carpet is the starting point, since it started the sequence of events leading to death."					
681	2.16.4 Duration					
682	"On death certificates, each reported condition should also include information about duration. The duration refers to the interval from the onset of the disease or condition to the time of death. Note that it is not always the same as the time of diagnosis of the condition, which may be at the same time as, or after, the onset of symptoms."					
683	2.16.5 First-mentioned sequence					
684	A death certificate may contain several sequences of acceptable causal relationships ending with the terminal cause of death. The coding instructions are given to identify the starting point of the first-mentioned sequence in Part 1 (See also Step SP4).					
685	"The figures below illustrate examples of certificates where each condition reported is shown by a circle. The starting point of the first-mentioned sequence is in grey, and the causal relationship of the first-mentioned sequence is indicated by an arrow."					
686	"To identify the first-mentioned sequence, begin with the terminal cause of death (the condition entered first on the first used line of Part 1). Check if the conditions on the next line in Part 1 can result in the terminal cause of death. If several conditions are reported on the same line, check from left to right in turn until you find a condition that could cause the terminal cause."					
687	"If no condition on the next line can cause the terminal cause of death, there is no sequence ending with the terminal cause of death. The terminal cause of death is the tentative starting point. Specific instruction is given also when you find no sequence (see Step SP5)."					
688	NoSequence					
689	No Sequence ending with the terminal cause of death					
690	"If there is a condition that can cause the terminal cause of death, the first condition found to be able to cause the terminal cause of death this is the tentative starting point. If there are no conditions reported on lower lines, the sequence between this tentative starting point and the terminal cause is the first-mentioned sequence."					
691	First Mentioned Sequence A					
692	First Mentioned Sequence B					
693	"If there are conditions reported on lower lines in Part 1, repeat the procedure for the next lower line. Start with the tentative starting point identified in the previous step. Check the conditions on the next lower line in Part 1, from left to right, to determine if they can cause the tentative starting point. Continue until you have found a condition that can cause the tentative starting point. This is the new tentative starting point."					
694	First Mentioned Sequence C					
695	First Mentioned Sequence D					
696	First Mentioned Sequence E					
697	First Mentioned Sequence F					
698	"If there are still conditions reported on lower lines in Part 1, repeat the procedure for as long as a new tentative starting point can be identified. When no condition can be found that could cause the tentative starting point, the last identified tentative starting point is also the starting point of the first-mentioned sequence."

706	2.16.6 Underlying cause of death (UCOD)					
707	"The underlying cause of death (UCOD), as defined in Section 2.15.1, is the condition selected for single-cause tabulation of mortality statistics."					
708	A condition that is provisionally considered as the underlying cause of death when applying the instructions step by step is referred to as a ‘tentative underlying cause of death (TUC)’ and may change several times as the instructions are applied to the death certificate.

710	"Generalised atherosclerosis started the sequence of events leading to death, so it is the starting point. There are special modification instructions relating to atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in the ICD, and, in the next step, coronary atherosclerosis is selected as the tentative underlying cause of death. But there are further instructions on coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction, and in the final step, myocardial infarction is selected as the tentative underlying cause, and is the underlying cause of death in this case."					
711	그림					
712	2.16.7 Priority underlying condition					
713	"Some mortality coding instructions (e.g. Steps SP6, M1) refer to the ‘priority underlying condition’. It is a concept to set a priority order giving precedence to the underlying condition, when specific requirements in each instruction apply to several conditions in the death certificate."					
714	"To identify the priority underlying condition, start from the first condition reported on the lowest used line of Part 1. If there are several conditions reported, search from the lowest used line, and the next line above in turn, and from left to right for each line. If you cannot find the priority underlying condition in Part 1, then search Part 2, again from left to right."					
715	그림 Priority Underlying Condition					
716	2.16.8 Modification					
717	"Special coding instructions on specific sequences and ICD categories may have the effect that a condition other than the starting point is selected as the underlying cause of death for use in the statistics. In such cases, the code for underlying cause often expresses a combination of the starting point with another reported condition, or a complication or consequence of the starting point that is of particular importance to public health. The procedure by which the ICD code for the starting point is replaced by another code is called modification. Instructions on how to apply these special instructions to identify the underlying cause of death is given in Section 2.18 Check for modifications of the starting point (Steps M1 to M4)."

(b)	Generalised atherosclerosis

(c)

(d)

719	"Generalised atherosclerosis started the sequence of events leading to death, so it is the starting point. However, according to a special instruction on generalised atherosclerosis, generalised atherosclerosis leading to heart disease is assigned to atherosclerotic heart disease in mortality statistics. Because of this modification, atherosclerotic heart disease is the underlying cause of death."					
720	2.17 Coding instructions for mortality					
721	"When coding causes of death, first assign ICD codes to all the conditions mentioned on the death certificate. Many coding instructions are based on specific ICD codes, and to determine whether or not any of the instructions apply, all conditions on the certificate must be coded. Other conditions reported on the certificate may affect the coding any condition. Assigning codes for all reported conditions and applying any effect one code has on another is called multiple cause coding."					
722	2.17.1 Basic coding and multiple cause coding guidelines					
723	"To start coding, refer to basic coding guidelines given in sections in the beginning of Part 2 (for example Sections 2.1, 2.6, and 2.10.1. When multiple causes are reported also refer to Section 2.20 Coding instructions for mortality: multiple cause coding and other specific instructions. Multiple cause coding permits in-depth analysis of causes of death, for example of serious but avoidable complications of certain underlying causes, and the impact of coexisting conditions on the outcome of a disease process. Therefore, in mortality coding, both underlying cause and multiple causes should be recorded. Complete multiple cause coding is essential for a correct application of the ICD instructions for selection and modification of the underlying cause of death."					
724	"Once ICD codes are assigned to each disease or condition on the certificate, apply the instructions to select the underlying cause of death."					
725	2.17.2 Selecting the underlying cause of death					
726	"For most death certificates, selecting the underlying cause of death is a straightforward procedure. There are, however, many cases where the underlying cause is not immediately obvious. To ensure that both straightforward and complex cases are coded according to the ICD mortality rules, it is important to follow the coding instructions carefully, step by step. Otherwise, the resulting mortality statistics will not be internationally comparable, which seriously reduces the value of the data for public health purposes."					
727	"Selecting the underlying cause of death involves two separate steps. The first step is to identify the starting point (Steps SP1 through SP8 below). The next step is to modify the starting point, if any of the modification instructions apply, to reflect further information provided on the death certificate (Steps M1 through M4 below). See Sections 2.18 - 2.19 for specific instructions. In addition, Mortality Annex 3.14.4 includes a workflow diagram to illustrate the coding instructions for the selection of the underlying cause of death. This is intended as a supplement to help coders follow the coding instructions."					
728	"Note that the purpose of the selection procedure is to produce the most useful mortality statistics possible. Thus, the following instructions may reflect the importance of some conditions for public health rather than what is correct from a purely medical point of view. The following instructions always apply, whether they might be considered medically correct or not."					
729	"In the coding examples that follow, the ‘due to’ statement between the lines in Part 1 is not included. But it is important to bear in mind that anything reported on an upper line in Part 1 is meant to be due to what is reported on the line below."

Each step contains one selection rule. At each step, there is a description of the selection rule itself and an instruction on what to do next."

In this case caries caused headache, a condition that is in the list of ill-defined conditions. Disregard both caries (Step SP8) and headache (Step SP7) and restart the selection procedure from Step SP1. Ischaemic heart disease is the new starting point (Step SP1)."					
817	2.18 Check for modifications of the starting point (Steps M1 to M4)					
818	"The starting point identified using Steps SP1 to SP8 is now considered the tentative underlying cause. There may be special coding instructions on this tentative underlying cause, or other reasons to modify the tentative underlying cause. Check whether the tentative underlying cause should be modified by applying the modification rules described in steps M1 to M3 (Modification rule 1 to Modification rule 3). Each step contains one modification rule. At each step, there is a description of the modification rule itself and what to do next. There are also bullet points with more detailed instructions and explanations."					
819	2.18.1 Step M1 – Special instructions					
820	"If the tentative underlying cause (TUC) selected in Steps SP1 to SP8 applies to a special instruction listed in Section 2.19.3 Special instructions on linkages and other provisions (Step M1), assign a new tentative underlying cause according to the instruction."					
821	"Next, reapply Step M1 to the new tentative underlying cause. Repeat until you have found a tentative underlying cause that is not affected by any further special coding instruction. Next, go to Step M2."					
822	"If the tentative underlying cause does not apply to instructions in Section 2.19.3, go to Step M2."					
823	"If more than one instruction in Section 2.19.3 applies to the tentative underlying cause, select the instruction relating to the priority underlying condition (see Section 2.16.7)."					
824	"Note that there are two types of combinations of codes, ‘with mention of’ and ‘when reported as a cause of’. Refer to Section 2.19.3 for details."					
825	Sometimes the classification itself indicates a code for a combination of the tentative underlying cause with another cause mentioned on the certificate. Use the combination code unless an instruction on mortality coding in Section 2.19.3 indicates otherwise.					
826	Examples of ‘with mention of’:

Although there is a special instruction on ‘atherosclerosis reported as the cause of chronic kidney disease’, this instruction does not apply here because chronic kidney disease is reported in Part 2 and not as caused by atherosclerosis. In this case, atherosclerosis remains the tentative starting point."					
840	2.18.2 Step M2 – Specificity					
841	"If the tentative underlying cause describes a condition in general terms and a term that provides more precise information about the site or nature of this condition is reported on the certificate, assign this more informative term as the new tentative underlying cause."					
842	"Next, reapply Step M2 to the new tentative underlying cause. Repeat until you have found a tentative underlying cause that cannot be specified further."					
843	"If there is no term that further specifies the tentative underlying cause, go to Step M3."					
844	The more specific description must refer to the same condition as the tentative underlying cause. Do not disregard a generalised condition such as atherosclerosis because a more specific but unrelated condition is reported on the certificate (see also Example 2).					
845	"If there are several other expressions that provide more precise information on the tentative underlying cause, select the priority underlying condition (see Section 2.16.7)."					
846	Note that the new tentative underlying cause itself is sometimes specified further by the general term (see Example 3).

There is a special instruction on ‘atherosclerosis reported with cerebrovascular accident’; apply this instruction and select cerebrovascular accident as the new starting point according to Step M1. The type of cerebrovascular accident is described more precisely in Part 2 as an arterial embolism to brain stem. This is the new tentative underlying cause.

854	"If, at this point, the tentative underlying cause is not the same as the starting point you selected in Steps SP1 to SP8, then go back to Step SP6. Repeat the procedures described in Steps SP6, M1 and M2."					
855	"If the tentative underlying cause is the same with the starting point selected in Step SP1 to SP8, go to Step M4."					
856	"Do not go back to Step SP6 if the cause selected in Step M1 or M2 is correctly reported as due to another condition, except when this condition is ill-defined."

Therefore, select arterial embolism of left leg as the tentative underlying cause in Step M2. Reapply Step SP6, because the tentative starting point is not the same as the one selected in Steps SP1 to SP8. But colon cancer is an obvious cause of arterial embolism, and colon cancer is the new starting point. No further modifications apply. Code colon cancer (2B90.Z), Malignant neoplasms of colon, unspecified) as the underlying cause of death."

Arterial embolism of left leg, reported as the second condition on line 1(b), is a more specific description of the type of arterial disease and is selected as the tentative starting point in Step M2. Do not reapply Step SP6, because arterial embolism of left leg is reported as due to atherosclerosis, and this is a correct causal relationship. No further modifications apply. Code ‘arterial embolism of left leg’ as the underlying cause of death."					
862	"2.18.4 Step M4 - Instructions on medical procedures, main injury, poisoning, and maternal deaths"					
863	"Finally, apply the following instructions to the tentative underlying cause selected by applying Steps SP1 to SP8 and Steps M1 to M3."					
864	If the tentative underlying cause is:					
865	"Surgery, another type of medical procedure, a complication or postprocedural condition, apply the instructions in Section 2.19.4 Special instructions on surgery and other medical procedures (Step M4)."					
866	"	In Chapter 22 ‘Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes’, first code the external cause of the injury or poisoning as the underlying cause of death. Also add the main injury to the cluster by following instructions in Section 2.19.5 Special instructions on main injury in deaths from external causes (Step M4)."					
867	"	In Chapter 23 ‘External causes of morbidity and mortality’ also add the main injury to the cluster by following instructions in Section 2.19.5 Special instructions on main injury in deaths from external causes (Step M4)."					
868	"	Poisoning, use additional extension code from Chapter X, if applicable, to identify the specific name of drug or toxic substance reported. If more than one drug or toxic substance is reported on the certificate, apply instructions in Section 2.19.6 Special instructions on poisoning by drugs, medications and biological substances (Step M4), to identify the drug, medicament or substance most likely to have caused the death."					
869	"If the decedent is a woman, and pregnancy, childbirth or puerperium is reported on the certificate, determine whether to code the tentative underlying cause to Chapter 18 ‘Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium’ according to the instructions in Section 2.19.7 Special instructions on maternal mortality (Step M4)."					
870	"When creating a cluster in Step M4, always put the code for the underlying cause of death at the beginning of the cluster."					
871	"After applying Step M4, the tentative underlying cause, modified or not, becomes the underlying cause of death."					
872	"If Step M4 does not apply, the tentative underlying cause becomes the underlying cause of death."					
873	"Note that other restrictions may apply, for example that the cause is limited to one of the sexes (see also Sections 2.21.7 and 3.14 (3.14.11 and 3.14.12)) or to a specific age range, or that the cause of death is improbable, considering the geographical setting. Therefore, always check whether any such restrictions apply to the underlying cause you selected."					
874	2.19 Special instructions on selecting the underlying cause of death					
875	The following sections are to be referred to in applying each instruction of Section 2.17.3 (Steps SP1 to SP8) and Section 2.18 (Steps M1 to M4).					
876	2.19.1 Special instructions on accepted and rejected sequences (Steps SP3 and SP4)					
877	"This section lists sequences of causes of death that should be accepted or rejected when selecting the underlying cause of death. As described in Section 2.16.2 Causal relationship and sequence, these instructions are set with the aim of producing the most useful mortality statistics. Individual countries should not correct what is assumed to be an error, since changes at the national level will lead to data that are less comparable to data from other countries, and thus less useful for analysis."					
878	"A reported causal relationship not listed as rejected in this section should be accepted, as far as possible, because the certifier’s opinion about the causes leading to death should not be disregarded lightly."					
879	"When applying Steps SP3 and SP4, reject the relationships listed in this section. Exceptions are listed as ‘accept’ in the table following each instruction."					
880	"Note that all information on causal relationship provided on the certificate should be considered. This applies also if the information appears in the ‘wrong’ place of the certificate. For example, if the sequence in Part 1 starts with a disease ‘A’, and information elsewhere on the certificate states that disease ‘A’ was due to a disease ‘B’, then consider ‘B’ as the tentative starting point. This also applies if disease ‘A’ and disease ‘B’ are coded to the same ICD-11 code and reported on separate lines of Part 1."

2115	2.20 Coding instructions for mortality: multiple cause coding and other specific instructions					
2116	"Multiple cause coding (see also Sections 2.21.1 - 2.21.8) permits in-depth analysis of causes of death, for example of serious but avoidable complications of certain underlying causes, and the impact of coexisting conditions on the outcome of a disease process. Therefore, in mortality coding, both underlying cause and multiple causes should be recorded. Also, complete multiple cause coding is essential for a correct application of the ICD instructions for selection and modification of the underlying cause of death (see Sections 2.17 - 2.19)."					
2117	"All possible detail should be retained in the multiple cause coding, since records containing all multiple cause conditions permit more thorough analysis than records with only a selection of the conditions reported on the death certificate. In particular:"					
2118	"the position of the individual codes in the data record should reflect where on the certificate the corresponding diagnostic expressions were entered by the certifier, because some analyses may focus on the terminal cause of death, or on conditions reported in Part 2"					
2119	"codes for common conditions, or for conditions regarded as symptomatic or less informative, should not be deleted or left out, since they may be of special interest in analysis of avoidable complications and may serve as markers of the seriousness of other conditions reported on the death certificate;"					
2120	multiple cause data should be stored in two formats:					
2121	1. one format that shows as clearly as possible which term the certifier used on the certificate and where on the certificate each term was reported					
2122	"2. one format that takes the stated or implied relationships between the reported conditions into consideration, and where the codes have been harmonised according to the instructions in the ICD volumes."					
2123	"Note that the syntax of a code string to retain ICD codes provided in a death certificate should be distinguishable from the syntax used for cluster coding in ICD (i.e. forward slash (/), ampersand (&)), while the specific syntax may differ according to different settings. Such code string could be for example, BD10|BA5Z*5A11/9B71.0Z, where a vertical bar (|) expresses the separator between lines in Part 1, and an asterisk expresses the separator between Part 1 and Part 2, and the forward-slash (/) shows the cluster as a separator between stems following the convention of ICD."					
2124	2.21 Mortality Rules – Knowledgebase					
2125	"The Mortality Knowledge Database will be a collection of rules that are used for determining the Underlying Cause of Death from death certificates. These rules will be based upon the Mortality coding guidelines of the ICD. The rules will cover permitted sequences, such as disease ‘a’ due to disease ‘b’, and cases where the selected cause may be modified to provide more relevant information for public health. Short summaries will describe the scope of a rule, and decision tables will specify explicitly and independent of language the use of the rule with the codes of the mortality tabular list. ‘Code sets’ of the decision tables will group ICD codes that often occur together in the knowledge base or are handled similarly by the selection and modification rules; for example, as causes or consequences of diseases with some common characteristic. The information on the rules will be maintained in a database, so that the data in the rules code table can be easily validated against changes in the classification, and vice versa."					
2126	"The decision tables can be used for manual coding and selection of the underlying cause of death, or for programming of software that assists in this task. In the past such Rule bases have been developed by users of ICD-10 mortality coding in an international approach, relying on decision for changes to the tables by an international group accredited by WHO."					
2127	2.21.1 Uncertain diagnosis					
2128	"Ignore expressions indicating doubt as to the certainty of the diagnosis, for example ‘apparently’, ‘presumably’, ‘probably’ or ‘possibly’. A tentative diagnosis, although uncertain, is of better use to mortality statistics than no diagnosis at all."					
2129	2.21.1.1 Either … or					
2130	"The certifier might report alternative diagnoses, ‘either diagnosis A or diagnosis B’. In such cases, proceed as follows."					
2131	"2.21.1.2 One condition, either one site or another"

2194	2.21.3.2 Modifying temporality of conditions by part-0-duration					
2195	Duration should not usually be used to qualify a condition as acute or chronic unless the Indexed Term provides specific part-0-duration or it is otherwise instructed in the reference guide (e.g. Section 2.21.8.1 Acute or chronic rheumatic heart diseases). Note that the Description in the classification is not to be used for coding (Section 3.4).					
2196	2.21.4 ‘Code also’ instructions in mortality use case					
2197	"Generally, the ‘code also’ instruction (see also Section 2.7.2.1 ‘Code also’ and ‘Use additional code, if desired’ instructions) is not used in in multiple cause coding since the information on aetiology is provided as a stand-alone expression separately on the death certificate and will be coded on its own, or is not provided at all."					
2198	"Apply the ‘Code also’ instruction when both information on the manifestation and the aetiology appear in a single diagnostic term reported by the certifier, and information on the aetiology is not reported separately. Whenever applying the ‘code also’ instruction, put the code for the aetiology at the beginning of the cluster and add the code for the manifestation."					
2199	Example 1: Heart failure					
2200	"BD10-BD1Z Heart failure has an instruction to ‘Code also’ the causing condition. However, in the diagnostic term reported by the certifier no information is given on such causing condition. Do not apply the ‘Code also’ instruction."					
2201	Example 2: Type 1 diabetic acidosis					
2202	"5A22 Diabetic acidosis has an instruction to ‘Code also’ the causing condition. The causing condition is reported, which in this case is 5A10 Type 1 diabetes mellitus. The aetiological condition Type 1 diabetes mellitus is considered the causing condition for primary tabulation and is coded first (5A10 Type 1 diabetes mellitus/5A22 Diabetic acidosis)."					
2203	Example 3: Salmonella Sepsis					
2204	Salmonella sepsis is an index term of 1G40 Sepsis without septic shock which has an instruction to ‘Code also’ the causing condition supplemented by a coding note to code the type of infection first. The type of infection in this case is 1A09 Infections due to other Salmonella and is coded first (1A09/1G40).					
2205	2.21.5 Malignant neoplasms					
2206	"ㆍTo assign the correct multiple cause code for a neoplasm, there are two concepts to consider: whether the reported neoplasms is primary or secondary, and its behaviour."					
2207	"ㆍThe primary site is the anatomical location where the neoplasm originated. A malignant neoplasm may spread to other parts of the body, and these sites are referred to as a secondary or metastasis."					
2208						
2209	ㆍMalignant - the neoplasm invades surrounding tissue or disseminates from its point of origin and begins to grow at another site					
2210	ㆍIn situ - the neoplasm is malignant but still fully confined to the tissue in which it originated					
2211	ㆍBenign - the neoplasm grows in the place of origin without the potential for spread					
2212	"ㆍUncertain behaviour - A neoplasm displaying morphologic, phenotypic, or genotypic characteristics that are clearly not benign but do not permit the establishment of a definitive diagnosis of malignancy"					
2213	ㆍUnknown behaviour - it is unknown whether the neoplasm is benign or malignant.					
2214	The broad structure of Chapter 02 ‘Neoplasms’ given below can be understood from these concepts as follows:					
2215	ㆍNeoplasms of brain or central nervous system (2A00-2A0Z)					
2216	ㆍNeoplasms of haematopoietic or lymphoid tissues (2A20-2B3Z)					
2217	"ㆍNeoplasms, except of lymphoid, haematopoietic, central nervous system or related tissues (2B50-2F9Z)"					
2218	"Neoplasms originating in the brain or central nervous systems, classified to 2A00-2A0Z, are further classified by site, histopathology or behaviour."					
2219	"Neoplasms originating in the haematopoietic or lymphoid tissues, classified to 2A20-2B3Z, are further classified by histopathology."					
2220	"In other words, 2A00-2A0Z or 2A20-2B3Z includes primary neoplasms, which could be either malignant or benign."					
2221	"Neoplasms originating in other sites are classified to ([2B50]-2F9Z) and this group is further classified by behaviour (i.e. malignant, in situ, benign, uncertain, or unknown), site or histopathology. Note that neoplasms originating in other sites and disseminating into the brain, central nervous system, lymphoid, haematopoietic tissues, are included here under the block of malignant neoplasm metastases."					
2222	"In mortality coding, it is most important to determine the primary site of the neoplasm. When the death certificate is ambiguous as to the primary site, every effort should be made to obtain clarification from the certifier. The instructions that follow should be applied only when clarification cannot be obtained."					
2223	"In the examples in this section, ICD codes are provided to the right of the death certificate. These codes represent the multiple cause codes assigned to each entry. These multiple cause codes could be different from a code assigned when the given diagnostic entry was reported alone on the certificate (direct coding). In such cases, the code for direct coding is given in curly brackets ‘{ }’ next to the diagnostic expression. The explanation for each example describes that the codes in brackets will be modified by other information on the certificate (application of multiple cause coding) and to code to the multiple cause code indicated to the right."					
2224	Using the coding tool for neoplasm					
2225	"Using the ICD coding tool, search for the term reported on the certificate to describe the neoplasm. If both histopathology and site are stated, enter both into the coding tool. If the histopathology is incompatible with the stated site of the neoplasm (i.e. the neoplasm cannot be primary of the stated site according to textbooks and other reference literature), then assign a code for a neoplasm of unspecified site for the histopathology indicated. If the histopathology is not stated, code by site and behaviour, if reported."					
2226	"Do not assign 2D43 Malignant neoplasms of independent, multiple primary sites when multiple neoplasms are mentioned. Code each malignant neoplasms by the coding tool, and select the underlying cause by applying the selection and modification rules in the normal way."					
2227	"2.21.5.1 Behaviour: malignant, in situ, benign, uncertain or unknown behaviour"					
2228	"To assign the correct multiple cause code for a neoplasm, first determine behaviour (malignant, in situ, benign, uncertain or unknown) for each of the neoplasms reported on the death certificate. For malignant neoplasms, also determine whether to code them as primary or secondary. To that end, apply the instructions that follow."					
2229	The term itself indicates behaviour					
2230	"First, use the coding tool to assign a code for terms used to describe the neoplasms. A specific histopathology or term may be assigned to a certain group of behaviour."					
2231	"For neoplasms coded to the following categories, presume it behaviour is malignant, unless otherwise specified, and go to Section 2.21.5.2 Malignant neoplasms: primary or secondary?:"					
2232	ㆍ2A00-2A0Z Neoplasms of brain or central nervous system					
2233	ㆍ2A20-2B3Z Neoplasms of haematopoietic or lymphoid tissues					
2234	ㆍ2A02.3 Benign neoplasm of cranial nerves					
2235	Note that the behaviour given by the coding tool for a specific term may change by other information on the certificate. Follow the instructions in this Section to decide the correct behaviour in multiple cause coding.					
2236	Other information on the certificate indicates behaviour					
2237	"If the term used to describe the neoplasm does not indicate a specific behaviour, then look for other information on the certificate indicating behaviour. Code a neoplasm of unspecified behaviour, a neoplasm described as ‘in situ’, or a growth that is not coded to Chapter 02 (for example, certain polyps), as malignant if any of the conditions below apply:"					
2238	"ㆍit is reported as the cause of secondary spread (terms such as infiltration, metastases, secondaries or similar) or of (malignant) cachexia, or;"					
2239	"ㆍit is reported immediately beside a mention of secondary spread, or;"					
2240	"ㆍit is reported immediately beside a mention of secondary spread, or;"					
2241	"ㆍthere is no mention of another neoplasm on the same part of the certificate, but there are other indications of malignancy reported anywhere on the certificate (for example, carcinosis, malignant cachexia, malignant transformation), or;"					
2242	ㆍit is reported as due to a malignant neoplasm.					
2243	"If a neoplasm is coded to the Chapter 02 category for benign neoplasm but is reported as the cause of metastases or infiltration, check for a code for a malignant variety in the coding tool and in the tabular list. If found, code it as malignant. If there is no code for a malignant variety, first try to obtain clarification from the certifier. If no further information is available, then accept the statement on the certificate and code the neoplasm as benign."					
2244	"If other information on the certificate indicates that a neoplasms is malignant, go to Section 2.21.5.2 Malignant neoplasms: primary or secondary? to assign the correct code."					
2245	"If there is no other information on the certificate that indicates behaviour, code as unknown behaviour.

2417	Note: The expression ‘metastatic’ often poses a problem in the English language. Countries using languages other than English should translate only as much as needed of this section.					
2418	"Neoplasms qualified as metastatic are always malignant. The adjective ‘metastatic’ can be used in two ways; mostly describing a primary tumour that has spread = metastasised to another site or organ (e.g. metastatic breast cancer), and sometimes describing the secondary site or location where the primary tumour has spread = metastasised (e.g. metastatic cancer in liver).
In the ICD-11 Foundation the adjective ‘metastatic’ followed by a site/organ (without a preposition) is always used in the meaning of a primary neoplasm of that particular site/organ that has spread into another site."					
2419	"For multiple cause mortality coding, always follow the instructions in this section. This applies even if the coding tool indicates an ICD code for a ‘metastatic’ neoplasm or ‘metastatic’ disease other than the code you would arrive at by following these instructions. For example, the search might lead to a code in the section for ‘malignant neoplasm metastases’, but the multiple cause coding instructions might tell you to code the neoplasm as primary. If so, follow the instructions and code the neoplasm as primary."					
2420	Malignant neoplasm ‘metastatic from’ a specified site					
2421	"If a malignant neoplasm is described as ‘metastatic from’ a specified site, or if a ‘due to’ relationship implies a spread from a specified site, code to primary of this site. This also applies to sites on the list of common sites of metastases. See Section 2.21.5.2 for the blocks used for primary malignant neoplasms."					
2422	Malignant neoplasm ‘metastatic to’ a specified site					
2423	"If a malignant neoplasm is described as ‘metastatic to’ a specified site, or if a ‘due to’ relationship implies a spread to a specified site, code to secondary of this site, whether the site is on the list of common sites of metastases or not. Use a code in 2D50-2E2Z ‘Malignant neoplasm metastases’ for this secondary site.

2456	A sequela is a chronic condition resulting from an acute condition and which begins during that acute condition. The acute condition is itself no longer present.					
2457	"The classification provides certain categories to be used when conditions are reported as sequelae, late effects, or other conditions specified in this section (e.g. 1G80-1G8Y Sequelae of infectious diseases). Where no specific category is provided for the condition described as a sequela (e.g. late effects of injuries are coded to the residual category of the chapter that may also include acute conditions), use additional code XT9C Cause of late effect, if desired, to identify that the first condition was reported as a cause of a sequela condition (e.g. Head injury sequelae: NA0Z&XT9C Injuries to the head, unspecified & Cause of late effect)."

2505	2.21.7 Consistency between sex of patient and diagnosis					
2506	"Most categories of ICD–11 apply to all persons without reference to sex. However, some diseases are more likely to occur in one biological sex. A list of those conditions is given in 3.14 Annex C: Annexes for Mortality Coding (3.14.11 List fo categories limited to, or more likely to occur in, female persons."					
2507	"When addressing cases of inconsistency between sex of patient and diagnosis reported, it is important to be aware of issues around gender identity. National legislation may regulate the recognition of gender identity or gender reassignment (sex-change) including protection of privacy. If there are special obligations to respect confidentiality around gender reassignment cases, these must be taken into account in the coding decisions and the onward dissemination of the coded data."					
2508	"The general recommendation for handling the situation where there is an apparent inconsistency between sex and diagnosis reported follows. However, this is a general guideline which may not always be applicable because legal requirements vary among countries."					
2509	"If there might be an inconsistency between the sex of the deceased and the cause of death reported: - check the information and make sure that no reporting error occurred. Further information may be available from the certifier or registration officials. If checking shows that either sex or diagnosis is an error, correct the one which is believed to be wrong."					
2510	"If no further information is available and: - it cannot be decided whether there is an error, or which of the two data items (sex and diagnosis) is the one that is wrong, retain the recorded sex and code to MH14 Other ill- defined and unspecified causes of mortality. - it appears that a gender reassignment case or similar situation is involved, retain the recorded sex and code if possible, to a substitute code which is similar to the reported diagnosis but not specific to either sex. For example, a neoplasm of sex-specific genital organs could be coded to 2D4Y Other specified malignant neoplasms of ill-defined or unspecified primary sites. If no suitable substitute code exists, code to MH14 Other ill- defined and unspecified causes of mortality."					
2511	"*Consider adding a note to the statistics, specifying the number of cases recoded because of apparent inconsistencies between sex and cause, while taking into consideration confidentiality required in each country."

2697	2.23 Main Uses of the ICD: Morbidity					
2698	"Morbidity data are used for statistical reporting mostly at national or local levels. While some of this statistical reporting is conducted within an academic research context, it is commonly conducted in applied settings to inform health system and public health agency decision- making. ICD coded data also forms the basis of different casemix systems such as different varieties of Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs). Coded morbidity data can also be used to inform a variety of clinical guidelines through provision of foundational information on burden of disease. The rules given here are primarily for international reporting and analysing purposes but are also recommended as a standard for national use."					
2699	2.23.1 ICD use in clinical care					
2700	"Clinical care comprises different levels of treatment, all of which mean a level of diagnostic capacity that is higher than in primary care. The ICD addresses this level of detail primarily through multidimensional coding. Secondary care refers to the health care services provided by medical specialists and other health professionals who generally do not have first contact with patients, for example, cardiologists, urologists, or dermatologists. It includes acute care, necessary treatment for a short period of time for a brief but serious illness, injury or other health condition, such as in a hospital emergency department. It also includes skilled attendants during childbirth, intensive care, and medical imaging services. ‘Secondary care’ is sometimes used synonymously with ‘hospital care’. However, many secondary care providers do not necessarily work in hospitals, such as psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, or physiotherapists, and some primary care services are delivered within hospitals. Depending on the organisation and policies of the national health system, patients may be required to see a primary care provider for a referral before they can access secondary care. Tertiary care refers to specialised consultative health care, usually for inpatients and following a referral from a primary or secondary health professional, in a facility that has personnel and facilities for advanced medical investigation and treatment, such as a tertiary referral hospital."					
2701	2.23.2 ICD use for epidemiological purposes					
2702	"Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events (including disease) and the application of this study to the control of diseases and other health problems. Various methods can be used to carry out epidemiological investigations- surveillance and descriptive studies are used to study distribution and analytical studies are used to study determinants. ICD coded data, either from morbidity or mortality sources, contribute to the understanding of the health of a population."					
2703	2.23.3 ICD use in quality and patient safety					
2704	"Coded health information is used to measure and report on various aspects of quality of care and patient safety (e.g. reporting on in-hospital mortality or adverse event rates for various conditions or reporting on patient safety indicators). Users of this kind of health information are health system payers (e.g. ministries of health, or in privately-funded health care systems, health insurance companies) and other stakeholders, such as health quality councils, hospital administrators, clinical leaders/groups, or public advocacy organisations."					
2705	2.23.3.1 The quality and safety use case for ICD–11					
2706	"The quality and safety use case of the ICD is based on the availability of large numbers of methodological tools that are originally based on ICD–10. Specific examples include the Charlson and Elixhauser co-morbidity indices, AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) Patient Safety Indicators, the Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratio, and various other administrative data quality indicators. WHO recommendations on coding rules for hospital separation episodes improve comparability of records across hospitals and jurisdictions. Specific examples of coding rules include: a) rules for specifying the main condition, b) numbers of codes per record, c) code clustering mechanisms, and d) use of a status display system that distinguishes diagnoses arising during a hospital stay from those present at admission. Quality and patient safety reporting is often focused not only on diagnostic information available in the International Classification of Diseases, but also on procedure information, that is currently coded in various country-specific procedure coding systems. The harmonisation of ontological concepts in international procedure coding systems will be important going forward. The available medical and surgical complication codes of ICD–11 are in line with current knowledge in the domain of safety and adverse events."					
2707	2.23.3.2 Reporting on indicators of quality of care and patient safety					
2708	"This use case relates to the use of coded health information to measure and report on various aspects of quality of care and patient safety (e.g. reporting on in-hospital mortality or adverse event rates for various conditions, or reporting on patient safety indicators). The initiating actor may be a health quality council, hospital administrators, clinical leaders/groups, a health system payer (e.g. ministries of health, or in privately-funded health care systems, health insurance companies) or a public advocacy ‘watch-dog’ organisations. The participating actors are hospital administrators, clinicians, health system decision makers, public representatives, patients and their families, and sometimes even the media. Requirements for reporting of quality and safety data are:"					
2709	"- Availability of person-level data on episodes of health care delivery (e.g. hospitalisations, physician visits) - Identifiers that permit attribution of the health care delivery episode to a provider, provider group, or a given health facility/hospital. - Clinical information on diagnoses present and procedures performed during a health care delivery episode. - Clinical information on relevant outcomes such as mortality, length of stay, and specific adverse events. - Analytical expertise among initiating actors so that attention is paid to data validity considerations, knowledge of ‘best’ indicators (e.g. the most valid patient safety indicators), risk adjustment methodology, etc."					
2710	"The outputs are reports containing information on dimensions of system quality. These can either provide global information on system performance, or comparative information stratified by provider unit (e.g. physician-level, hospital-level, or regional reporting)."					
2711	2.23.3.3 Functionality:					
2712	"An ideal course of events for such use would include: - The initiating actor communicates desire to conduct quality/safety measurement and reporting to relevant stakeholders. - Appropriate applications are made to secure access to the data needed to conduct the planned reporting. - Appropriate methodological and clinical expertise is enlisted to ensure that best methodological practices are incorporated into the planned reporting, and that clinical face validity and acceptability are considered. - Data analysis and reporting are undertaken. - Broad dissemination and knowledge translation to stakeholders is undertaken. A continuous quality improvement process is undertaken in response to reports (with consideration given to quality improvement interventions, and repeat measurement after intervention)."					
2713	"- Exceptions: Quality/safety reporting that does not follow the sequence of steps described above can be compromised. Indeed, there are many historical instances of failed or suboptimal quality/safety reporting from administrative data because of skipped steps. (e.g. 1. quality reporting without valid indicators, or appropriate methodologies for risk adjustment, 2. quality reporting without good clinical face validity, 3. quality reporting without a Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) mind set, etc.)."					
2714	"- Examples of sub-use cases (addressing the quality dimensions of effectiveness, efficiency, safety, access) - reporting on global mortality by facility (e.g. the hospital standardised mortality ratio - HSMR) - reporting on condition-specific mortality - reporting on patient safety indicators - reporting on global or condition-specific length of stay - reporting on readmission rates after hospitalisation - reporting on global or condition-specific costs of care (e.g. cost per hospitalisation) - reporting on waiting times - reporting on small area variability in utilisation"					
2715	2.23.3.4 Additional information:					
2716	Requirements:					
2717	"See ‘Requirements’ section above. There needs to be ongoing development and refinement of quality reporting methodologies (in essence, ongoing research around the development of new administrative data quality indicators and new methodologies for risk adjustment in outcome/quality reporting)."					
2718	Assumptions:					
2719	"An underlying assumption in quality or patient safety reporting from administrative data is uniformity of data format and data validity across comparator units (i.e. across provides, hospitals, or jurisdictions). Uniformity in data format and validity is not always present and has been a common reason for criticism of quality or patient safety reports derived from administrative data. In this regard, WHO is promoting ongoing efforts towards standardised coding rules help to facilitate comparative reporting by reducing data variability across comparator units (e.g. rules on factors such as the definition of the ‘main condition’, numbers of possible codes per record, and the implementation of diagnosis-timing codes). See also the separate use case description for international comparative reporting."					
2720	"In countries with well developed health information systems, it is quite typical for episodes of hospital-based care to be recorded with varying numbers of ICD codes describing all medical conditions/diagnoses that impacted an episode of care. Furthermore, some systems allow for distinction between diagnoses that were present at time of admission versus diagnoses that arose de novo during the hospital stay. In such systems, the resulting “discharge abstract” can be used for comprehensive and routine morbidity reporting, within which quality and safety concepts are a core component. These include: - adverse events causally linked to medical care - problems in the care process (e.g. error in administration of drug), but without actual adverse event - new diagnoses arising during a hospital stay where causal link to medical care is uncertain"					
2721	"To record and analyse the occurrence of such events, it is crucial for health information systems to have routine morbidity reporting, within which quality and safety concepts are an important component of morbidity coding."					
2722	2.23.3.5 Recommendations for use and interpretation of coded data					
2723	These recommendations apply to the use of records in which data were captured and organised as recommended in the previous section: - Select records involving a quality or patient safety event: these are all records with any quality or patient safety harm code. - Summarise types of quality or patient safety harm represented in a set of records: select records with any quality or patient safety harm code. - Summarise the distribution of quality or patient safety Harm codes present in the selected set. - Summarise quality or patient safety causes of harm in a set of records. - Summarise quality or patient safety mechanisms in a set of records. - Summarise quality or patient safety harm in a set of records.					
2724	2.23.3.6 ICD use for research purposes					
2725	"The morbidity use case for ICD–11 includes a number of situations where the primary goal is to work in an academic research paradigm to extract information from ICD–11 coded data to study burden of disease, clusters of disease, geographic distribution of diseases, and health impacts associated with various diseases. The research paradigm is of course most relevant when it has translational relevance to either health system policy or public health policy, in which case the research paradigm, labelled as such, becomes indistinguishable from applied morbidity analyses conducted for the purposed of health planning. Explicit mention is made here of the widespread use of ICD–11 coded data in a research paradigm, recognising that this is a significant driver for developing a clinically rich and detailed classification system, with novel features and coding rules that enhance the classification’s potential as a research tool."					
2726	2.23.3.7 ICD use in primary care					
2727	"Primary care has been defined as essential front line health care based on practical, scientifically sound, and socially acceptable methods and technology made universally accessible to individuals and families in the community through their full participation and at a cost that the community and the country can afford to maintain. Of relevance to primary care, ICD–11 includes many diagnostic and disease entities that are common reasons for care at the first level of health services. This could be family practitioners, local health nurses, or in other settings also specialists, like Ophthalmologists."					
2728	"ICD–11 has a simplified version for low diagnostic resource primary care settings. For high diagnostic resource settings, the tabular list for mortality and morbidity statistics contains all elements relevant to primary care and is thus able to be used in high resource environments for primary care, as well as for secondary and tertiary care."					
2729	"The new version of WONCA’s (World Organization of National Colleges, Academies, and Academic Associations of General Practice/Family Practitioners) International Classification of Primary Care and the ICD–11 will share a common subset of categories."					
2730	"ICD–11 has a simplified version shaped for low resource primary care settings. For high resource settings, the tabular list for mortality and morbidity statistics contains elements relevant to primary care and is thus able to be used in high resource environments for primary care, as well as for secondary and tertiary care."					
2731	2.23.3.8 ICD use in Casemix groupings					
2732	"In casemix grouping systems such as the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) system, ICD based data are used for reimbursement and/or resource allocation. Such systems are used nationally in systematic fashion."					
2733	"The assignment of patient cases to groups is based on an algorithm using, in addition to coded diagnosis information, coded procedures, and a number of other variables. The scientific basis of the casemix systems is grounded in health care economics and in the theory of medicine. Since casemix systems are an essential part of administration in countries that use them, smooth transfer to the new revision of the ICD in these systems is essential for the approval and implementation of the new revision."					
2734	"ICD–11 has been developed to accommodate the different levels of detail that are required in diagnosis-related casemix groupings, in close collaboration with the custodians of the diverse casemix systems. Joint use in a specific casemix system is driven by the relevant grouper algorithms, and partly also by national legislation."					
2735	"For matters of international comparability of hospital activity, it is recommended that countries adopt the new WHO definition of main diagnosis and country implementations of ICD–11 apply the new extension codes for the types of diagnoses that are provided with ICD–11."					
2736	"For international tabulations, in view of the differences in definitions of hospital, episode and in-patient, the resulting diagnoses are listed with the aid of the International Shortlist for Hospital Morbidity Tabulation (refer to section 2.25)."					
2737	2.23.4 What is coded: Patient conditions					
2738	2.23.4.1 Main condition					
2739	The definition of main condition relates to the description of an episode of hospital-based care.					
2740	"The health care practitioner should record and identify as the main condition the one condition that is determined to be the reason for admission, established at the end of the episode of health care. This determination is supported through evaluations and investigations that aim to establish the diagnosis responsible for the admission."					
2741	2.23.4.2 Multiple conditions contributing to need for admission					
2742	"Where an episode of health care includes more than one condition contributing to the need for admission (e.g. congestive heart failure and pneumonia; acute cerebral haemorrhage and hip fracture; multiple injuries - concussion, rib fracture, right femur fracture after MVA; or influenza A and Type 1 diabetic ketoacidosis), the health care practitioner should record and identify the main condition to be the one condition that is deemed to be the most clinically significant reason for admission."					
2743	2.23.4.3 Other conditions					
2744	"In addition to the main condition, the health care practitioner should, whenever possible, also list separately all other conditions or problems dealt with during the episode of health care. Other conditions (also known as additional diagnoses) are defined as those conditions that coexist at the time of admission or develop during the episode of health care and affect the management of the patient. Conditions related to an earlier episode that have no bearing on the current episode should not be recorded as other conditions. It is recommended, where practicable, to carry out multiple-condition coding and analysis to supplement the routine data."					
2745	2.23.5 Health care practitioner documentation guidelines for morbidity coding					
2746	"The health care practitioner responsible for the patient’s treatment is also responsible for documenting the patient’s health conditions. This information should be organised systematically by using standard recording methods. A properly completed medical record is essential for good patient management. It is also an essential prerequisite to the creation of a valid coded record of patient diagnoses, derived through a coding process from written information describing a patient’s medical condition. When a good written record of patient conditions is available, successful coding of this information in ICD and associated classifications produces a valuable source of epidemiological and other statistical data on morbidity and other health care problems."					
2747	"The person transforming the information on the stated condition to codes (the ‘coder’) may be the health care practitioner or a clinical coder who is not responsible for the patient’s treatment but is specially trained in use of the classification to assign the code(s). In the latter situation, which is quite common among member countries, the coder depends on the adequacy of clinical documentation relating to the patient’s condition(s) provided by health care practitioners in the medical record. The primary importance of clinical documentation by health care practitioners as the starting point for coded health data cannot be overstated and needs to be underlined as being a matter of key importance within countries and internationally – with implications for health information and clinical documentation teaching within health care practitioner training programs."					
2748	"For clinical and resource allocation purposes, in many instances, the manifestation of a disease (kind and severity, e.g. ulcer grade 3) may be more relevant during a specific treatment episode than the underlying disease (e.g. Diabetes mellitus). For prevention programs at national levels, knowledge about the underlying aetiology may be more important. Quality and safety assessments will require reporting additional detail related to the stay. For comprehensive analysis and use of morbidity data, it is crucial to have a dataset with multiple fields allowing capture of codes relating to all the aspects above."					
2749	"Morbidity data are increasingly being used in the formulation of health policies and programmes, and in their management, monitoring and evaluation, in epidemiology, in identification of at risk populations, and in clinical research (including studies of disease occurrence in different socioeconomic groups)."					
2750	"In the context of these morbidity coding rules, the term practitioner is used throughout the morbidity rules to mean physician or any qualified health care practitioner who is legally accountable for establishing the patient’s diagnosis. This information should be organised systematically by using standard recording methods. A properly completed record is essential for good patient management and is a valuable source of epidemiological and other statistical data on morbidity and other healthcare problems."					
2751	"The term episode is used for all settings, including hospital admissions. It is acknowledged that the definition may be different in each country, though it is most often considered to be a continuous hospital care period, which begins on the first day of a patient’s admission to a health care facility and ends on the day upon which they are separated from that facility through discharge, transfer or death. Some countries consider sequential care periods on different wards within the same hospital to be distinct episodes of care."					
2752	"The health care practitioner responsible for the patient’s treatment is also responsible for documenting the patient’s health conditions during an episode of health care. Good clinical documentation is critical to continuity and quality of patient care, communication between members of the treatment team, patient safety and is the legal record of a patient’s episode of care. When a sound written record of patient condition(s) is available, successful coding of this information using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and associated classifications produces a valuable source of morbidity data to support:"					
2753	"Health care planning, management, monitoring and evaluation"					
2754	Epidemiology					
2755	Identification of risk populations					
2756	Clinical research					
2757	Reimbursement and health care funding.					
2758	"The health care practitioner responsible for the patient’s treatment should select and document the main condition, as well as any other conditions, for each episode of health care. It is recommended, where practicable, that all conditions are documented to support multiple condition coding and analysis to supplement routine data collection and reporting."					
2759	2.23.5.1 Documentation guidelines involving the term ‘Multiple’-For Single condition reporting					
2760	"In cases involving, for example, ‘multiple fractures’, ‘multiple head injuries’ or ‘multiple valvular disease’, it is acceptable documentation practice to record the diagnoses using the term ‘multiple’ and then list separately the specific conditions or injuries. For example, Multiple fractures of pelvis: fracture of os pubis, sacrum, ilium."					
2761	2.23.5.2 Specificity and detail					
2762	Each diagnostic statement should be as informative as possible in order for the clinical coder to classify the condition to condition to a code that best captures the specific detail provided in the diagnostic statement. Examples of such diagnostic statements include:					
2763	transitional cell carcinoma of trigone of bladder					
2764	acute appendicitis with localised peritonitis					
2765	meningococcal pericarditis					
2766	pregnancy-induced hypertension					
2767	diplopia due to reaction to antihistamine taken as prescribed					
2768	osteoarthritis of hip due to an old hip fracture					
2769	fracture of neck of femur following a fall at home					
2770	full thickness burn of palm of left hand due to grilling accident					
2771	unintentional puncture of the sigmoid colon during colonoscopy					
2772	2.23.5.3 Unconfirmed diagnoses					
2773	"If no definite diagnosis has been established at the end of an episode of health care, then the health care practitioner should document the information that permits the greatest degree of specificity and knowledge about the reason for admission that has been established at the end of the episode of care. This could be a symptom, abnormal finding or problem. Rather than qualifying a diagnosis as “possible”, or “suspected”, when a diagnosis has been considered but not established, when applicable, record the symptom, abnormal finding or problem."					
2774	2.23.5.4 Documentation of a ruled out condition					
2775	"The health care practitioner should document as main condition a “ruled out” condition when the episode of care involves a person who presents some symptoms or evidence of an abnormal condition which requires study, but who, after examination and observation, show no need for further treatment, follow-up or other medical care."					
2776	"The health care practitioner should not document a ruled out condition as a main condition if some treatment was provided for a symptom or follow-up is required to determine the cause of the sign or symptom. In that instance, the health care practitioner should document the presenting sign or symptom that was treated as the main condition."					
2777	Example 1					
2778	"Admitted for suspected deep vein thrombosis of leg, which after investigation is ruled out and no follow-up necessary."					
2779	Main Condition: Ruled out deep vein thrombosis.					
2780	Example 2					
2781	"A child is found playing with an empty acetaminophen bottle. The mother is uncertain if there were any tablets in the bottle. The child is brought to the hospital and following investigation, it is determined that the child did not ingest any pills"					
2782	Main condition: Ruled out unintentional ingestion acetaminophen (paracetamol)					
2783	Example 3					
2784	A patient had an elevated PSA and presented for biopsy of the prostate. Biopsy revealed no evidence of malignancy. No further follow-up planned for the patient.					
2785	Main condition: Ruled out prostate malignancy					
2786	See Section 2.23.17 Coding a “ruled out” condition for more detail.					
2787	2.23.5.5 Contact with health services for reasons other than illness					
2788	"Episodes of health care or contact with health services are not restricted to identification, treatment or investigation of current illness or injury. Episodes may also occur when someone who may not currently be sick requires or receives limited care or services. In this case the health care practitioner should document the details of the relevant circumstances as the ‘main condition’."					
2789	Examples include:					
2790	monitoring of previously treated conditions					
2791	immunisation					
2792	"contraceptive management, antenatal and postpartum care"					
2793	surveillance of persons at risk because of personal or family history					
2794	"examinations of healthy persons, e.g. for insurance or occupational reasons"					
2795	seeking of health-related advice					
2796	requests for advice by persons with social problems					
2797	consultation on behalf of a third party					
2798	organ or tissue donors					
2799	"circumstances related to drugs, procedures, or devices without documented injury or harm to patient"					
2800	Chapter 24 ‘Factors influencing health status and contact with health services’ provides a broad range of categories for classifying these circumstances. Reference to this chapter will give an indication of the detail required to permit coding to the most relevant category.					
2801	2.23.5.6 Conditions due to external causes					
2802	"When a condition such as an injury, poisoning or other effect of an external causes is recorded, it is important to document fully both the nature of the condition and the circumstances that gave rise to it. For example:"					
2803	‘fracture of neck of femur caused by fall due to slipping on pavement’					
2804	"‘cerebral contusion caused when patient lost control of car, which hit a tree’"					
2805	"‘unintentional poisoning, patient drank disinfectant in mistake for soft drink’"					
2806	"‘severe hypothermia, patient fell in her garden in cold weather’"					
2807	See also Section 2.23.20.2 Causation in the context of quality and safety.					
2808	2.23.5.7 Documentation of sequelae					
2809	"Where an episode of care is for the treatment or investigation of a residual condition (sequela) of a disease that is itself no longer present, the health care practitioner should document the residual condition (sequela) and its origin, together with a clear indication that the original disease is no longer present. For example:"					
2810	‘deflected nasal septum– fracture of nose in childhood’					
2811	‘contracture of Achilles tendon – late effect of injury to tendon’					
2812	‘infertility due to tubal occlusion from old tuberculosis’.					
2813	"Where multiple sequelae are present and treatment or investigation is not directed predominantly at one of them, a documented statement such as ‘sequelae of cerebrovascular accident’ or ‘sequelae of multiple fractures’ is acceptable."					
2814	2.23.6 Coder guidelines for selecting ‘main condition’ and ‘other conditions’ for coding purposes					
2815	"The main condition and other condition(s) relevant to an episode of health care should have been identified and recorded by the responsible health care practitioner, and coding will therefore usually be straightforward. The main condition recorded should be accepted for coding and reporting unless it is obvious that the health care practitioner did not follow the guidelines for recording diagnostic information for morbidity data analysis. Whenever possible, a record with an obviously inconsistent or incorrectly recorded main condition should be returned to the health care practitioner for clarification."					
2816	"If clarification of potentially erroneous documentation is not possible, one of the following rules can be applied by the clinical coder and the main condition reselected for reporting purposes. The rules are for use when it is unclear which recorded condition should be selected as the main condition for reporting purposes."					
2817	MB1 Several conditions recorded as ‘main condition’; or					
2818	"MB2 Condition recorded as ‘main condition’ is presenting symptom of diagnosed, treated condition; or"					
2819	MB3 Signs and symptoms recorded as ‘main condition’ with alternative conditions recorded as the cause					
2820	Coder rules for reselection of main condition					
2821	2.23.6.1 MB1 - Several conditions recorded as ‘main condition’					
2822	"If several different conditions (that cannot be classified to a single stem code) are recorded as the ‘main condition’, and other details on the record point to one of them being the ‘main condition’ (one condition determined to be the reason for admission established at the end of the episode of care), select that condition; otherwise, select the condition first recorded."					
2823	"If there is the desire to also report other discharge diagnosis types i.e. main resource condition or initial reason for encounter or admission, then the applicable extension code(s) from Chapter X ‘Extension codes’, should be assigned to indicate the different types of discharge diagnosis types that are reported."					
2824	Example 1:					
2825	"A patient was admitted with complaints of fever, chills, severe headache and stiff neck. Following investigation, a diagnosis of staphylococcal meningitis was confirmed. While in hospital the patient developed pneumonia."					
2826	Main condition: Staphylococcal meningitis. Pneumonia					
2827	"Two conditions have been recorded as the main condition and querying the health care practitioner is not possible. The details in the example point to staphylococcal meningitis as the one condition being the reason for admission established at the end of the episode of care, therefore the coder should code staphylococcal meningitis as the ‘main condition’. Pneumonia is coded as an ‘other condition’. It meets the definition of an ‘other condition’ as it is a diagnosis that arose during the episode of care."					
2828	Example 2:					
2829	A patient who has a history of COPD was admitted for a biopsy of the prostate. Patient was evaluated for COPD. Biopsy was performed and the final diagnosis from pathology results was benign prostatic hypertrophy.					
2830	Main condition: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Hypertrophy of prostate.					
2831	"Two conditions have been recorded as the main condition and querying the health care practitioner is not possible. The details in the example point to benign prostatic hypertrophy as the condition being the reason for admission established at the end of the episode of care; therefore, the coder should code hypertrophy of prostate as the ‘main condition’. COPD is coded as an ‘other condition’ as the physician documented it as co-existing at the time of admission and affecting the management of the patient."					
2832	Example 3:					
2833	"A patient presents to hospital at 35 weeks gestation with spontaneous premature rupture of membranes. She is not having any contractions. Examination reveals the baby is in breech presentation; therefore, delivery by caesarean section is recommended. Mother delivers healthy preterm infant by caesarean section."					
2834	Main condition: Premature rupture of membranes. Breech presentation.					
2835	Procedure: Delivery by caesarean section					
2836	"Two conditions have been recorded as the main condition and querying the health care practitioner is not possible. The details in the example point to premature rupture of membranes as the condition being the reason for admission established at the end of the episode of care. Therefore, the coder should code premature rupture of membranes as the ‘main condition’ and breech presentation and preterm delivery as ‘other condition’."					
2837	Example 4:					
2838	A patient is admitted to the hospital with pneumonia and congestive heart failure.					
2839	Main condition: Pneumonia and Congestive Heart Failure.					
2840	"Two conditions have been recorded as the main condition and querying the health care practitioner is not possible. There are no other details on the record to point to one of the conditions as being the main condition, therefore, in this instance, the coder should code the first listed condition as the main condition. Pneumonia is coded as the ‘main condition’ and congestive heart failure is coded as an ‘other condition’."					
2841	"2.23.6.2 MB2 - Condition recorded as ‘main condition’ is presenting symptom of diagnosed, treated condition"					
2842	"If a symptom or sign (usually classifiable to Chapter 21 Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified), or a problem classifiable to Chapter 24 Factors influencing health status or contact with health services, is recorded as the ‘main condition’, and this is obviously the presenting sign, symptom or problem of a diagnosed condition recorded elsewhere and care was given for the latter, reselect the diagnosed condition as the ‘main condition’."					
2843	Example 1:					
2844	The patient presents to hospital with complaint of haematuria. Investigations reveal a papilloma in the posterior wall of the bladder as the cause of the haematuria. The papilloma was excised by diathermy.					
2845	Main condition: Haematuria					
2846	Other conditions: Papilloma of posterior wall of bladder					
2847	"Haematuria (symptom) is recorded as the main condition; however, it was determined to be caused by the papilloma of the bladder (diagnosed and treated condition). Therefore, the coder should reselect and code papilloma of posterior wall of bladder as the ‘main condition’."					
2848	Example 2:					
2849	The patient presents to hospital with abdominal pain. Investigations reveal acute appendicitis and the patient undergoes an appendectomy.					
2850	Main condition: Abdominal pain					
2851	Other conditions: Acute appendicitis					
2852	"The symptom ‘abdominal pain’ was recorded as the main condition; however, it was determined to be caused by appendicitis. Therefore, the coder should reselect and code acute appendicitis as the ‘main condition’."					
2853	Example 3:					
2854	A patient with known COPD is admitted to hospital with acute respiratory failure which after investigation is found to be caused by an acute exacerbation of COPD.					
2855	Main condition: Acute respiratory failure					
2856	Other condition: Acute exacerbation of COPD					
2857	"The symptom “acute respiratory failure” was recorded as the main condition; however, it was determined to be caused by exacerbation of COPD with acute exacerbation. Therefore, the coder should reselect and code the COPD as the ‘main condition’"					
2858	2.23.6.3 MB3 - Signs and symptoms recorded as ‘main condition’ with alternative conditions recorded as the cause					
2859	"Where a symptom or sign is recorded as the ‘main condition’ with documentation that it may be due to either one condition or another, select the symptom as the ‘main condition’."					
2860	Example 1:					
2861	Main condition: Headache due to tension or acute sinusitis					
2862	"The symptom ‘headache’ is recorded as the main condition with two possible causes; therefore, the coder should code headache as the ‘main condition’."					
2863	2.23.7 Coding using postcoordination in morbidity					
2864	"A significant new feature in ICD–11 is an embedded functionality for postcoordinating detail related to diagnostic concepts see Section 2.10.2 Combining stem codes and extension codes, and how to order these in a complex code cluster, and Section 2.10.1 Adding detail – postcoordination and cluster coding with multiple stem codes and extension codes."					
2865	The postcoordinated coding of diagnostic concepts described by the health care practitioner is shown in the following examples:					
2866	Example 1					
2867	"A patient is admitted to the hospital for laser treatment of their diabetic retinopathy due to Type 2 diabetes mellitus. During the admission the patient’s medication for arterial hypertension required adjustment on a number of occasions before discharge. Code as main condition the diabetic retinopathy, unspecified postcoordinated with the stem code type 2 diabetes mellitus (9B71.0Z/5A11). Code the other condition, essential hypertension (BA00.Z)."					
2868	"For morbidity coding, the order of the codes in the first cluster in Example 1 has the diabetic retinopathy ordered first as it is the diabetic retinopathy that meets the definition of main condition followed by the causing condition Type 2 diabetes. (Note: The classification instructs to code also the type of diabetes.)"					
2869	"Where an established causal relationship is not documented or cannot be inferred, the two stem codes cannot be part of the same cluster."					
2870	Example 2					
2871	"Patient admitted for right cataract extraction. The patient also has Type 2 diabetes mellitus and was reviewed by the endocrinologist and dietitian for their long-term diet and insulin plan. Code the main condition as Cataract, unspecified, right (9B10&XK9K). Code the other condition as Type 2 diabetes mellitus (5A11)."					
2872	"Example 2 demonstrates postcoordination where a causal relationship between the cataract and the Type 2 diabetes has not been documented and cannot be inferred; therefore, the two stem codes for each condition are reported separately. Postcoordination for the laterality for the cataract was applied here"					
2873	2.23.7.1 Coder rule for use of extension codes					
2874	Adding detail to Stem codes using Extension Codes					
2875	Type 2 extension codes (a new section of codes in ICD–11) provide distinct codes that serve as concept modifying flags for marking how a diagnosis is to be used and/or interpreted. Examples of these extension code modifiers include:					
2876	Discharge diagnosis types (main condition; main resource condition; initial reason for encounter or admission);					
2877	Diagnosis certainty (Provisional diagnosis; Differential diagnosis)					
2878	Diagnosis Timing (Present on admission; Developed after admission; Uncertain timing of onset relative to admission)					
2879	"For more detail about the use of all available extension codes, see Section 2.9Extension codes."					
2880	Example 1					
2881	A patient is admitted to hospital with chest pain and after investigation is diagnosed with a myocardial infarction and then develops a stroke that leads to a one-month hospitalisation. Myocardial infarction is coded as the main condition because it was the reason for admission established at the end of the stay. The stroke is coded separately and can be postcoordinated with a diagnosis-type extension code flag indicating that the stroke diagnosis arose after admission.					
2882	"Such a system with diagnosis flags meets the objectives of countries that want a reason-for-admission coding rule, while also meeting the objectives of countries that want to be able to make inferences regarding complications of care and resource consumption (which are of relevance to casemix systems and patient safety and quality assessments)."					
2883	2.23.8 Coding from health care practitioner documentation of ‘causal relationships’					
2884	"Sometimes conditions that have a causal relationship are clearly documented by the health care practitioner using terms such as ‘due to’, ‘caused by’, or ‘arising from’. These connecting terms indicate the health care practitioner has made a causal link between, for example, condition A due to condition B. However, sometimes conditions are documented with connecting terms that are ambiguous for the coder such as ‘with’, ‘after’, ‘in’, and ‘following’. When ambiguous terms are documented, and it is not clear whether the health care practitioner means a causal relationship or not, the clinical coder should code each condition separately and not link the conditions in a cluster."					
2885	The clustering (postcoordination) is a particularly notable new feature in ICD-11 that has permitted the introduction of powerful new clinical coding mechanisms for capturing clinical information in dimensions such as:					
2886	quality and safety coding for health care related injury and harms (see three-part model described in Section 2.23.20.1)					
2887	injury and the external cause of injury					
2888	the addition of clinical detail using extension codes					
2889	the specification of diagnosis type and diagnosis timing using extension codes					
2890	the comprehensive description of late effects (sequelae) arising from prior conditions (See Section 2.21.6)					
2891	the description of inter related stem code diagnoses where there is a clear causal relationship between them					
2892	"For more information on causal inference in the context of quality and safety, refer to Section 2.23.20.2 Causation in the context of quality and safety"					
2893	"2.23.9 Coding of suspected conditions or symptoms, abnormal findings and non-illness situations"					
2894	"If the episode of health care was for an inpatient, the coder should be cautious about classifying the main condition to Chapters 21 Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified and Chapter 24 Factors influencing health status or contact with health services. If a more specific diagnosis has not been made by the end of the inpatient stay, or if there was truly no codable current illness or injury, then codes from the above chapters are permissible. The categories can be used in the normal way for other episodes of contact with health services."					
2895	"If, after an episode of health care, the main condition is recorded as ‘suspected’, ‘questionable’, etc., and there is no further information or clarification, the suspected diagnosis must be coded as if established."					
2896	Example 1					
2897	"Main condition: Suspected acute cholecystitis If there is no further information available that indicates that a definitive diagnosis was reached, code to acute cholecystitis, unspecified (DC12.0Z) as ‘main condition’."					
2898	Example 2					
2899	"Main condition: Severe epistaxis. Patient in hospital one day. No procedures or investigations reported. Code to epistaxis (MD20). Although epistaxis is a sign/symptom, it is acceptable since the patient was obviously admitted to deal with the immediate emergency only."					
2900	2.23.10 Coding using combination categories					
2901	The ICD provides certain categories where two conditions or a condition and an associated secondary process can be represented by a single code (i.e. precoordinated concept). Such combination categories should be used where appropriate information is recorded.					
2902	Example 1:					
2903	"Main condition: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Stage 4 secondary to hypertensive renal disease Other condition: Essential hypertension Code to Chronic Kidney disease, stage 4 (GB61.4) and add the Hypertensive renal disease (BA02) in a cluster. Main condition Cluster: GB61.4/BA02 Other condition: BA00 Essential hypertension"					
2904	Example 2:					
2905	Main condition: Glaucoma secondary to eye inflammation Code to 9C61.24 Glaucoma due to eye inflammation. This is a precoordinated code in ICD-11.					
2906	Example 3:					
2907	"Main condition: Diabetic cataract. Type 1 diabetes mellitus Other conditions: Hypertension Code Diabetic cataract (9B10.21) and ‘code also’ the type of diabetes mellitus (5A10). Postcoordinate the stem code for diabetic cataract and stem code for Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Main condition Cluster: 9B10.21/5A10. The hypertension is not linked to the cataract or diabetes, so it is not part of the cluster. It is coded as an ‘other condition’."					
2908	Example 4:					
2909	"Main condition: Rheumatoid arthritis Other conditions: Hypertension, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Cataract Code to Rheumatoid arthritis, serology unspecified (FA20.Z) as ‘main condition’. Code the other conditions (hypertension (BA00.Z), type 2 diabetes mellitus (5A11), cataract (9B10.Z)) separately. If any optional extension codes are added to any one of the conditions, then a cluster(s) is created as applicable because extension codes cannot be reported alone. Note that in this example, the linkage (through clustering) of cataract with diabetes must not be made as the cataract has not been documented as a diabetic cataract. In this case there is no combination indicating clustering should be used."					
2910	Main condition: FA20.Z Other condition: BA00.Z Other condition: 5A11 Other condition: 9B10.Z					
2911	2.23.11 Coding using external causes of morbidity					
2912	"For injuries and other conditions due to external causes, both the nature of the condition and the circumstances of the external cause should be coded. The preferred ‘main condition’ code should be that describing the nature of the condition. This will often, but not always, be classifiable to Chapter 22 Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes. The code from Chapter 23 External causes of morbidity or mortality indicating the external cause is assigned as an additional code and postcoordinated with the nature of the condition as it may be regarded as a modifier. See also Section 2.23.20.1."					
2913	Example 1:					
2914	"Main condition: Fracture of neck of femur caused by fall Other conditions: Contusions to elbow and upper arm The health care practitioner has identified the fracture as the main condition and since there is no other information to make the coder question the main condition recorded, the coder should code fracture of neck of femur, unspecified (NC72.2Z) as the ‘main condition’. The external cause code for unintentional fall from unspecified height (PA6Z) is used as an additional code linked to the fracture code through postcoordination. The contusion of elbow (NC30.1) and upper arm (NC10.1) are coded as another condition cluster and the external cause code for unintentional fall (PA6Z) is linked to the contusion code through postcoordination."					
2915	Main condition cluster: NC72.2Z/PA6Z Other condition cluster: NC30/NC30.1/NC10.1					
2916	Example 2:					
2917	"Main condition: Hip fracture from fall Other condition: Severe hypothermia resulting from exposure to the cold weather Code to NC72.2Z Fracture of neck of femur, unspecified as ‘main condition’ and postcoordinate the external cause code for PA6Z Unintentional fall from unspecified height. Code as “other condition” hypothermia (NF02) and postcoordinate the external cause code PB16. Main condition cluster: NC72.2Z /PA6Z Other condition cluster: NF02/PB16"					
2918	Example 3:					
2919	"Main condition: Diplopia due to reaction to antihistamine taken as prescribed Code to diplopia 9D46 and postcoordinate the external cause code for PL00 Drugs, medicaments or biological substances associated with injury or harm in therapeutic use and PL13.2 Drug-related injury or harm in the context of correct administration or dosage, as mode of injury or harm. An optional extension code may be added to identify the specific drug was an antihistamine XM4J58."					
2920	Main condition cluster: 9D46/PL00&XM4J58/PL13.2					
2921	2.23.12 Coding of acute and chronic conditions recorded as main condition					
2922	"Where the main condition is recorded as being both acute (or subacute) and chronic, and the ICD provides separate categories or subcategories for each, but not for the combination, the code for the acute condition should be reported as the main condition (the condition determined to be the reason for admission established at the end of the episode of care). When an appropriate combination code is provided for both the acute and chronic condition, assign the combination code as the main condition."					
2923	Example 1:					
2924	Main condition: Acute on chronic cholecystitis Code DC12.00 Acute on chronic cholecystitis as the ‘main condition’. This is an example of combination code for both the acute and chronic condition in ICD-11.					
2925	Example 2:					
2926	"Main condition: Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Code to CA22.0 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with acute exacerbation, unspecified as the ‘main condition’ since the ICD provides an appropriate single precoordinated code for the combination."					
2927	2.23.13 Coding of injuries or harm arising from surgical or medical care					
2928	Refer to Section 2.23.20.1 Overview of code-set in ICD–11 for quality and patient safety.					
2929	2.23.14 Coding of adverse events and circumstances in health care that do not cause actual injury or harm					
2930	Refer to Section 2.23.20.1 Overview of code-set in ICD–11 for quality and patient safety.					
2931	2.23.15 Coding of chronic postprocedural conditions					
2932	"Most body-system chapters also contain categories for permanent (chronic) conditions that occur either as a consequence of specific procedures and techniques or as a result of the removal of an organ, e.g. postmastectomy lymphoedema syndrome, post-irradiation hypothyroidism. Immediate or acute conditions that occur as a consequence of a procedure may require coding with the 3-part quality and safety model. See also Section 2.23.20.1 Overview of code-set in ICD–11 for quality and patient safety. The categories of postprocedural conditions do not have residual codes (i.e. other and unspecified). This is intentional so as to prevent users inadvertently classifying conditions to these categories that should, in fact, be classified elsewhere."					
2933	2.23.16 Coding ‘History of’ and ‘Family history of’					
2934	"Chapter 24 ‘Factors influencing health status or contact with health services’ of the classification includes a number of codes that describe both a personal history of various conditions, and a family history of various conditions. The classification of this documented concept may be coded in one of two ways."					
2935	Option 1: Assign the applicable stem code from Chapter 24 ‘history of’ (or ‘family history of’) by itself.					
2936	"Option 2: Assign the applicable stem code from Chapter 24 clustered with a code from another chapter to add specificity as to what the previous ‘disease’ was. The order of stem codes in the cluster is always the ‘history of’ stem code first, followed by any other codes that may be added for detail."					
2937	Example 1:					
2938	A patient has history of sigmoid colon cancer that was curatively resected. Code: QC40.0 Personal history of malignant neoplasm of digestive organs/2B90.3 Malignant neoplasm of sigmoid colon					
2939	"In example 1, it is acceptable to code only QC40.0 as the code simply captures the notion that the patient has a personal history of cancer of the digestive organs. However, the documented clinical concept (history sigmoid colon cancer) is fully described through use of the clustering mechanism and linking of stem codes QC40.0/2B90.3."					
2940	Example 2:					
2941	"A patient has a family history of macular degeneration. Code: QC66 Family history of eye or ear disorders/9B78.3Z Degeneration of macula or posterior pole, unspecified"					
2942	2.23.17 Coding a “ruled out” condition					
2943	"Many health care encounters are undertaken to evaluate patients for suspected conditions, to then determine after investigations that the patient does not have the condition in question. In medical documentation, such scenarios often use the term “ruled out”. It is essential for health information systems to have an ability to report on such encounters."					
2944	"ICD-11 includes a number of codes that can be used to describe encounters where a suspected condition has been “ruled out”. These appear in Chapter 24 as children of QA02 Medical observation or evaluation for suspected diseases or conditions, ruled out. Some of these codes specify the suspected condition in question:"					
2945	"Observation for suspected malignant neoplasm, ruled out"					
2946	"Observation for suspected tuberculosis, ruled out"					
2947	"Observation for suspected allergy or hypersensitivity, ruled out"					
2948	"In many other common scenarios, there is no code for a specified suspected condition, in which case, QA02.Y Medical observation or evaluation for other suspected diseases or conditions, ruled out, is used. In such cases, postcoordination can be used to specify the suspected condition that was ruled out. The classification of the documented concept “ruled out” may be coded in one of two ways. Option 1: Assign the applicable code from QA02 Medical observation or evaluation for suspected diseases or conditions, ruled out, by itself. Option 2: Assign the applicable code from QA02 Medical observation or evaluation for suspected diseases or conditions, ruled out, clustered with a code from another chapter to add specificity as to what was the suspected disease that was ruled out. The order of stem codes in the cluster is always the QA02 stem code first."					
2949	Example 1					
2950	"Admitted for suspected deep vein thrombosis of leg, which after investigation is ruled out and no follow-up necessary. Main Condition: Ruled out deep vein thrombosis. Code main condition cluster: QA02.Y/BD71.4"					
2951	Explanation: QA02.Y indicates that an other specified condition was ruled out and postcoordination allows specification of what the suspected condition was (deep vein thrombosis leg).					
2952	Example 2					
2953	"A child is found playing with an empty acetaminophen bottle. The mother is uncertain if there were any tablets in the bottle. The child is brought to the hospital and following investigation, it is determined that the child did not ingest any pills. Main condition: Ruled out unintentional ingestion of acetaminophen. Code: QA02.5 Observation for suspected toxic effect from ingested substance, ruled out. Explanation: In this example, QA02.5 specifies the condition that was ruled out."					
2954	2.23.18 Coding of conditions documented as sequela (late effect)					
2955	"‘Sequelae’ include residual effects of diseases or disorders, injuries or poisonings specified as such, or as late effect of, arrested, cured, healed, inactive, old or quiescent condition unless there is evidence of active disease. Conditions documented as a sequela (late effect) will typically be classified using postcoordination depending on the case."					
2956	The cluster should contain:					
2957	"first, a stem code identifying the specific manifestation (i.e. nature of the effect), and"					
2958	"second, a stem code designating ‘late effect of’ (either a code from the body system chapters or a code from Chapter 24 Factors influencing health status or contact with health services)"					
2959	"third, if required, a stem code representing the prior condition causing the sequelae"					
2960	"Note: Coding of sequelae of an injury with all detail will require four codes in the cluster, the fourth code being the external cause code."					
2961	Example 1:					
2962	"Joint contracture present as a late effect of a prior burn. Code cluster: FA34.3 Contracture of joint QC50 Late effect of prior health problem, not elsewhere classified NE11 Burn of unspecified body region/PB1Z Unintentional exposure to unspecified thermal mechanism"					
2963	Example 2:					
2964	"Hemiplegia present as a late effect of old cerebral ischemic stroke. Code cluster: MB53.Z Hemiplegia, unspecified/8B25.0 Late effects of cerebral ischemic stroke Note: In Example 2, the concept of late effect and underlying cause is already precoordinated in the stem code 8B25.0"					
2965	2.23.19 Standards and coding instructions for injury events					
2966	"The WHO definition of an ‘injury’ is: ‘acute exposure to physical agents such as mechanical energy, heat, electricity, chemicals, and ionizing radiation interacting with the body in amounts or at rates that exceed the threshold of human tolerance. In some cases, (for example, drowning and frostbite), injuries result from the sudden lack of essential agents such as oxygen or heat’. Injuries may be categorised in a number of ways. However, for most analytical purposes and for identifying intervention opportunities, it is especially useful to categorise injuries according to whether or not they were deliberately inflicted and by whom. Commonly used categories are:"					
2967	unintentional (i.e. accidental)					
2968	intentional (i.e. deliberate)					
2969	interpersonal (e.g. assault and homicide)					
2970	"self-harm (e.g. abuse of drugs and alcohol, self-mutilation, suicide)"					
2971	legal intervention (e.g. action by police or other law enforcement personnel)					
2972	"war, civil insurrection and disturbances (e.g. demonstrations and riots)"					
2973	undetermined intent					
2974	"Regarding the collection of events that cause injuries, a set of definitions apply. See section ‘Definition related to transport injury events’ below."					
2975	2.23.19.1 Descriptions related to transport injury events

2978	"c. A road traffic injury event is any unintentional injury occurring on the public highway [i.e. originating on, terminating on, or involving a vehicle partially on the highway]. An unintentional injury involving a vehicle is assumed to have occurred on the public highway unless another place is specified, except in the case of unintentional injury involving only off-road motor vehicles, which are classified as unintentional injury not caused by traffic unless the contrary is stated."					
2979	"d. An off-road, nontraffic road injury event is any unintentional injury that occurs entirely in any place other than a public highway."					
2980	"e. A pedestrian is any unintentionally injured person involved who was not at the time of the event riding in or on a motor vehicle, railway train, streetcar or bus or animal-drawn or other vehicle, or on a pedal cycle or animal."

3165	2.23.20 Conceptual model for quality and patient safety					
3166	"Exposure to health care events sometimes has unintended and undesired consequences. Health care, the people to whom it is provided, and the complications that can arise in the course of care are highly diverse and complex. Representing them comprehensively in an information system is challenging and is presently beyond the bounds of practicality for routine administrative information systems of the types that are intended to make use of the ICD. The conceptual model has three components:"					
3167	1. Harm to the patient: What was the main consequence for the patient’s health?					
3168	2. Cause or source of harm: What caused the harm?					
3169	Mode or mechanism: In what way? How did the source of harm actually produce harm?					
3170	2.23.20.1 Overview of code-set in ICD–11 for quality and patient safety					
3171	"A key feature of the quality and patient safety code-set in ICD–11 is that a cluster of codes is required to represent a case. Use of the term ‘cluster’ is novel in ICD–11 and so is the extent and formalisation of the requirement for postcoordination. The quality and safety use case of the ICD is based on the availability of large numbers of methodological tools that are originally based on ICD–10. Specific examples include the Charlson and Elixhauser co-morbidity indices, AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) Patient Safety Indicators, the Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratio, and various other administrative data quality indicators. WHO recommendations on coding rules for hospital separation episodes are designed to improve comparability of records across hospitals and jurisdictions. Specific examples of coding rules include:"					
3172	"rules for specifying the main condition, numbers of codes per record, code clustering mechanisms, and use of a status display system that distinguishes diagnoses arising during a hospital stay from those present at admission."					
3173	"Quality and patient safety reporting is often focused not only on diagnostic information available in the International Classification of Diseases, but also on procedure information, that is currently coded in various country-specific procedure coding systems. The harmonisation of ontological concepts in international procedure coding systems will be important going forward. The available medical and surgical complication codes of ICD–11 are in line with current knowledge in the domain of safety and adverse events."					
3174	"There are three parts to the Quality and Safety model. The first component, quality and patient safety Harm, is usually represented by a standard ICD–11 diagnosis code, from (almost) any chapter of the classification. Some forms of harm that can result from quality and safety events are not adequately represented by a standard ICD–11 diagnosis code. A special set of categories to represent these forms of harm are provided in the injury chapter of ICD–11 (Chapter 22 ‘Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes’), under the category titled ‘Injury or harm arising from surgical or medical care, not elsewhere classified’. Quality and patient safety causes (sources of harm) fall into four types of causes at the top level that capture events caused by:"					
3175	"1. substances (drugs and medicaments, etc.),"					
3176	"2. procedures,"					
3177	"3. devices, and"					
3178	4. a mix of other types of causes.					
3179	The full quality and safety external cause codes are found in Chapter 23 ‘External causes of morbidity or mortality’ within category titled ‘Causes of health care related harm or injury’.					
3180	"Quality and safety Mode or Mechanism (‘Mode’ is the term used in ICD-11 external cause codes) is the second part of the model, and refers to the main way in which the Quality and safety Cause leads to the Harm which is represented in the third concept, Quality and safety Harm. Quality and safety Modes are specific to the types of Quality and safety Cause. Examples are:"					
3181	Table 1: Examples of corresponding quality and safety mode or mechanism					
3182	Cause or Source of Harm	Mode or Mechanism				
3183	Substance	"Overdose, underdose, incorrect substance, or harm arising despite correct administration and dosing"

3245		Cluster	4B00.01/PL00&XM86W0/PL13.2			
3246	"Note that in each of these examples, a mode/mechanism of harm is coded alongside the cause of harm code for all cases. This is true, even when a mode of harm is not apparent. In the latter situations, a code for ‘mode or mechanism of injury unspecified’ should be selected, for any of substance-related harm, procedure-related harm, or device-related harm. For the ‘other health care related causes’ the harm should be coded (from anywhere in the classification) followed by code PL10 Other health care related causes of injury or harm followed by the appropriate code from category PL14 Mode of injury or harm associated with other health care related causes (where there are several mode options)."					
3247	"Considerations around distinguishing poisoning versus overdose of drugs, medicaments or biologic substances in the clinical context"					
3248	"It is important to make a distinction between an overdose in the context of clinical care and a poisoning that is not in a clinical context. The former would be coded using codes in the ‘Causes of health care related harm or injury’ section of Chapter 23, whereas poisonings would be coded in the ‘Unintentional causes’ or ‘Intentional self-harm’ sections of Chapter 23."					
3249	The following scenarios will help to illustrate the distinction:					
3250	"1. An adult medical inpatient receives an overdose of a prescribed medication, because an excess dose is inadvertently injected by a nurse."					
3251	"2. An adult inadvertently takes an overdose of their own prescribed medication, because the physician wrote the prescription incorrectly."					
3252	"3. An adult inadvertently takes an overdose of their own prescribed medication, because they were given incorrect instructions by the pharmacist."					
3253	"4. An adult inadvertently takes an overdose of their own prescribed medication, because they misunderstood instructions on the pill bottle and verbal instructions given to them by both the pharmacist and their doctor."					
3254	"5. An adult inadvertently takes an overdose of their own prescribed medication, and it is unclear from documentation or case investigation as to why a mistake was made."					
3255	6. An adult takes and overdose of their own prescribed medication with undetermined intent.					
3256	7. An adult intentionally takes an overdose of their own prescribed medication with intent for self-harm.					
3257	8. A child ingests a number of pills from his mother’s prescribed pill bottle and becomes somnolent.					
3258	"Scenario 1 is clearly an overdose arising from an error in a health care context, while scenario 8 is clearly a poisoning of a child who is not in a therapeutic health care context."					
3259	"Scenario 7 should also be coded as an episode of poisoning, because the pills were not taken with a therapeutic intent, but with intent for self-harm (the ‘Intentional self-harm’ concept overrides other considerations)."					
3260	"Scenarios 2 and 3 are overdoses arising from problems in a health care context (and are coded using the’ Causes of health care related harm or injury’ codes). In both scenarios, the context is one of medication treatment, and the actions of health care providers."					
3261	"Scenarios 4, 5 & 6 are less straightforward, though rather common in patient care. The context of the medication use is still clearly that of treating a medical condition and the fact that the medication was prescribed to the patients makes it a context of therapeutic use (provided there is no mention of intentional self-harm). Because of the therapeutic context, these scenarios should be coded using the ‘Causes of health care related harm or injury’ codes, rather than poisoning codes"

3263	Figure 1: Flowchart for coding poisoning versus overdose.					
3264	"Instructions on when the three-part quality and safety model applies, and when it does not"					
3265	"The above sections and examples describe scenarios in which an aspect of care (a drug, procedure, device, or other aspect of care) has been causally linked to a condition that a patient has developed. In many instances, however, conditions arise in the health care setting without explicit documentation suggesting a causal link to an aspect of care. Specific examples include:"					
3266	pulmonary embolism arising two days after a surgical procedure					
3267	atrial fibrillation after surgery					
3268	low blood pressure one day after administration of a drug					
3269	pneumonia developing on day four of a hospital stay					
3270	urinary tract infection arising in hospital without any mention of catheters					
3271	"In each of these examples, the three-part model for quality and safety would NOT apply if there is no explicit documentation asserting a causal link to another aspect of care, whether that is a drug, procedure, device, or other aspect of care. Importantly, the mere mention of a surgical procedure or a drug administration in the above examples, does NOT mean that those factors played a causal role, because the clinical statements merely declare timing of the diagnosis, with descriptive words like ‘after’, ‘following’, ‘occurring on day XX’. In such cases, the correct coding of the conditions would be to code the medical condition from any chapter from ICD-11 along with an extension code for timing (in particular, the extension codes for diagnoses arising during a hospital stay, plus or minus the optional extension codes for intraoperative or postoperative timing of a diagnosis)."					
3272	The above examples would be coded in the following way:					
3273	BB00.0 Acute pulmonary thromboembolism &XY69 Developed after admission &XY7V Postoperative					
3274	BC81.3 Atrial fibrillation &XT5R Acute &XY69 Developed after admission &XY7V Postoperative					
3275	"BA2Z Hypotension, unspecified &XY69 Developed after admission"					
3276	"CA40.Z Pneumonia, organism unspecified &XY69 Developed after admission"					
3277	"GC08.Z Urinary tract infection, site and agent not specified &XY69 Developed after admission"					
3278	2.23.20.2 Causation in the context of quality and safety					
3279	There are nuances of language in documentation that will indicate whether there is a causal link between a cause and harm.					
3280	Connecting terms implying a causal relationship					
3281	A causal relationship is strongly suggested by the following terms:					
3282	Terms	Additional Notes				
3283	"as (a) complication of, complicated by, complicating, complication(s) of"	-				
3284	"as a cause of, cause of, caused, caused by, causing"	-				
3285	"as a result of, resulted in, resulting in, with resultant, with resulting"	-				
3286	because of	-				
3287	due to	-				
3288	from	-				
3289	"induced, induced by"	-				
3290	"leading to, led to"	-				
3291	"related to,"	-				
3292	precipitated by	-				
3293	producing	-				
3294	secondary to	-				
3295	likely related to	"Coding judgment call. However, the clinician is making a causal inference with this term"				
3296	"possibly secondary to, probably secondary to"	"Coding judgment call. However, the clinician is making a causal inference with this term"				
3297	may be the reason for	"Coding judgment call. However, the clinician is making a causal inference with this term"				
3298	Connecting terms where the causal relationship is unclear					
3299	"Occasionally there may be connecting terms that hint at causation, but without explicit assertion of a causal link. Examples are shown below. In these circumstances, coders need to check with the documenting clinician, or look for supplementary wording or ancillary information that implies causation."					
3300	Terms					
3301	Associated with					
3302	Accompanied by					
3303	Incidental to					
3304	Connecting terms NOT implying a causal relationship					
3305	"In clinical documentation, terms are often used to describe a temporal association. The many terms listed in the preceding table (from ‘connecting terms implying a causal relationship’) are connecting terms that do suggest a causal association that is typically also a temporal association. In contrast, there are a number of terms that describe only temporal associations. Examples of such terms are listed below:"					
3306	Terms					
3307	after					
3308	also					
3309	and					
3310	during					
3311	with					
3312	arising in or during					
3313	consistent with					
3314	"followed by, following"					
3315	incurred after/during/in/when					
3316	occurred after/during/in/when/while					
3317	"postoperatively, postoperative, occurred post-op"					
3318	"If connecting terms of this sort appear in clinical documentation without any of the causal connectors discussed earlier, avoid using the three-part quality and safety model."					
3319	"Terms like ‘postoperative’, ‘post-op’, ‘postprocedural’, etc., are a special situation because these have historically been considered, in some coding systems to be indicative of a causal link. However, as noted in the specific examples above, conditions such as urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and atrial fibrillation may temporally arise after surgery, without necessarily being caused by surgery. It is for this reason that the guidelines presented here instruct coders to look for explicit causal connections. (Importantly, postoperative conditions such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and atrial fibrillation can still be coded with informative extension codes that specify timing – i.e. ‘arising during hospital stay’ and/or ‘postoperative’–and permit the derivation of adverse events in indicators in data analysis)."					
3320	Other specific situations where the clinical context implies a causal relationship					
3321	"There are some clinical situations where there may not be connecting terms that explicitly point to causation, but where the clinical circumstances nevertheless clearly point to causation. Some examples appear below:"					
3322	Specific situations					
3323	failed device					
3324	infected device					
3325	loose screws					
3326	postprocedural bleeding					
3327	post-op wound infection					
3328	dehiscence					
3329	wound hematoma					
3330	"In each of these, it is clear that the situation would not have occurred in the absence of a procedure or a device problem. Accordingly, the three-part quality and safety model should be applied."					
3331	"In contrast, conditions such as postoperative pneumonia or postoperative pulmonary embolism, or postoperative atrial fibrillation are different than the specific situations listed in the table above. This is because problems such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, or atrial fibrillation can be triggered by factors unrelated to the surgical procedure (i.e. different from a ‘wound’ that is without question caused by surgery)."					
3332	2.23.20.3 Chronic postprocedural conditions					
3333	"There are many chronic clinical conditions that occur either as a consequence of specific procedures and techniques or as a result of the removal of an organ, e.g. postmastectomy lymphedema syndrome, postirradiation hypothyroidism. In many instances, codes for such chronic postprocedural conditions are in ICD-11 within various body system chapters."					
3334	Examples include:					
3335	BE10 Postcardiotomy syndrome					
3336	"5D40.Z Postprocedural hypothyroidism, unspecified"					
3337	GC72 Postprocedural urethral stricture					
3338	GC70 Postoperative adhesions of vagina					
3339	"These are, by their very nature, precoordinated codes that capture both the a clinical condition and the notion of it being caused by a procedure. It is possible to use such codes on alone without any clustering. However, coders can use the three-part model with such codes to add specificity. The model allows the addition of more specificity about the specific type of surgical procedure that caused the condition, and also the mode through which the procedure caused the condition."					
3340	Example 1: Urethral stricture due to previous radiation for treatment of prostate cancer.					
3341	Code to GC72 Postprocedural urethral stricture Further detail can be added to the code GC72 with the addition of: PK81.C Radiation therapy associated with injury or harm in therapeutic use and PL11.Y Other specified mode of injury or harm associated with a surgical or other medical procedure Cluster: GC72/PK81.C/PL11.Y					
3342	"Note, however, that there will occasionally be instances where it is entirely unnecessary to use the three-part model because the code for the chronic postprocedural condition already contains full clinical detail. For example:"					
3343	"9D21 Cataract lens fragments in eye following cataract surgery (for this, it would be highly redundant to code “ophthalmic procedure” and a corresponding mode, given all the detail that is inherently embedded in this single code)."					
3344	"EL61 Chronic radiodermatitis following radiotherapy (again, redundant to code “radiation therapy” as the procedure causing harm, and “mode unspecified” for this case)."					
3345	"In relation to the two preceding examples, we reiterate that the overriding recommendation is that the three-part model should be used whenever possible. Coders must simply make a case by case judgement when it is obvious to them that the added procedure code and mode code are redundant."					
3346	2.23.20.4 Adverse events and circumstances in health care that do not cause actual injury or harm					
3347	"There are instances in the context of health care where things happen to patients, and where problems arise, but where there is no actual adverse consequence to the patient as a recorded medical condition. Specific examples include:"					
3348	A fall in the health care setting without fracture or other injury					
3349	An incorrect drug administered without harm to patient					
3350	A drug given to the wrong patient without harm to the patient					
3351	A delay in drug administration without negative effect on clinical course					
3352	Documented failure of sterile precautions in a surgical procedure without ensuing infection					
3353	Dislodged orthopaedic device without symptoms or problems					
3354	Inadvertent needle stick without documented injury or other harm					
3355	"In these circumstances, codes should be chosen from Chapter 24 Factors influencing health status or contact with health services in the section of codes entitled ‘Health care related circumstances influencing the episode of care, without documented injury or harm’. These codes are organised using the four categories of health care related harm that appear in Chapter 23 External causes of morbidity or mortality (drugs, devices, procedures and other health care related causes), but with the important distinction that the circumstances being described through coding did NOT cause actual harm to the patient."					
3356	The above examples would be coded in the following way:					
3357	QA8E Fall in health care without injury or harm					
3358	QA72 Incorrect substance without injury or harm					
3359	QA8D Patient received diagnostic test or treatment intended for another patient without injury or harm					
3360	QA8B Delayed treatment without injury or harm					
3361	QA52 Failure of sterile precautions without injury or harm					
3362	"QA62 Dislodgement, misconnection or de-attachment without injury or harm"					
3363	QA8F Needle stick without injury or harm

3366	2.23.20.5 Recommendations for data capture and organisation					
3367	Information systems must be capable of capturing the three components and marking the three codes as belonging to the same cluster (see also instructions for postcoordination and cluster coding).					
3368	2.23.21 Chapter-specific notes					
3369	Coder guidance is given below for specific chapters where problems may be encountered in selecting preferred ‘main condition’ codes. The preceding general guidelines and rules apply to all chapters unless a specific chapter note states otherwise.					
3370	2.23.21.1 Chapter 1: Infectious and parasitic diseases					
3371	Human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] disease					
3372	"A patient with a compromised immune system due to HIV disease may sometimes require treatment during the same episode of care for more than one disease, for example mycobacterial and cytomegalovirus infections. Only subcategories for HIV disease associated with, tuberculosis, and malaria are precoordinated in this block for HIV disease. When another specified HIV-caused disease is documented by the health care practitioner, postcoordinate the HIV-caused disease with the appropriate subcategory for HIV disease as recorded by the health care practitioner."					
3373	Example 1:					
3374	The patient has HIV disease and is admitted for treatment of Kaposi sarcoma of the soft palate.					
3375	Main condition: Kaposi sarcoma due to HIV disease					
3376	"Kaposi sarcoma is documented as an HIV-caused disease. Therefore, the stem code for Kaposi sarcoma is postcoordinated with the applicable stem code for HIV."					
3377	Main condition: 2B57.Y Kaposi sarcoma of other specified primary sites &XA8HL5 Soft palate/1C62.3 HIV disease clinical stage 4 without mention of tuberculosis or malaria.					
3378	Example 2:					
3379	The patient has HIV disease and is admitted for treatment of toxoplasmosis.					
3380	Main condition: Toxoplasmosis due to HIV					
3381	"Main condition: 1F57.Z Toxoplasmosis, unspecified/1C62.3 HIV disease clinical stage 4 without mention of tuberculosis or malaria"					
3382	Sepsis with or without septic shock					
3383	The concept of sepsis has undergone major changes during the last decades and the current description established and widely accepted internationally in 2016 is that sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.					
3384	"Sepsis is not considered to be a disease in itself, but a reaction to an infectious disease which may be of bacterial, viral, fungal or protozoal aetiology. Septic shock is defined as a subset of sepsis in which circulatory, cellular and metabolic abnormalities are profound enough to substantially increase mortality."					
3385	A cluster involving a case of documented sepsis should include:					
3386	"First, a stem code representing the causing infection (specified or unspecified) and as applicable, an optional extension code for the infectious agent if it is known."					
3387	"Second, a stem code for sepsis with or without septic shock depending on the documentation"					
3388	"Note: If the causing infection is documented as generalised or a specific infection is not documented, assign a stem code for greatest level of specificity documented in relation to the infection."					
3389	Example 1:					
3390	Patient admitted for treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia causing sepsis					
3391	Main condition: Pneumococcal pneumonia causing sepsis					
3392	"Code first the causing infection, CA40.07 Pneumonia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae and postcoordinate with the stem code for 1G40 Sepsis without septic shock"					
3393	Main condition cluster: CA40.07/1G40					
3394	Example 2:					
3395	Patient admitted for treatment of severe influenza A H1N1 causing sepsis.					
3396	"Code first the causing infection, Influenza 1E30 Influenza due to identified seasonal influenza virus with optional extension code for (XN297 Influenza A H1N1 virus) and postcoordinate with the stem code for (1G40 Sepsis without septic shock)"					
3397	Main condition cluster: 1E30 &XN297/1G40					
3398	Example 3:					
3399	Patient admitted for treatment of sepsis due to E.coli.					
3400	Main condition: Sepsis due to E Coli.					
3401	"Code first the causing infection. In this example, a specific infection is not documented; therefore a code for (1C41 Bacterial infection of unspecified site), is coded with optional extension code for (XN6P4 Escherichia coli) and postcoordinate with the stem code for (1G40 Sepsis without septic shock)."					
3402	Main condition cluster 1C41&XN6P4/1G40					
3403	Example 4:					
3404	Patient presented with septic shock and died shortly after admission.					
3405	"Main condition: Septic shock, unknown infection"					
3406	"Code first the causing infection. In this example, a specific infection is unknown; therefore, a code for [1H0Z Infection, unspecified] and then postcoordinate with the code for (1G41 Sepsis with septic shock)"					
3407	Main condition cluster: [1H0Z] /1G41					
3408	2.23.21.2 Chapter 2: Neoplasms					
3409	"When coding neoplasms, refer to the instructions regarding code assignment at the level of the individual categories, and the use of additional morphological or site descriptions from the extension codes. A neoplasm, whether primary or metastatic, that is the focus of care during a relevant episode of health care, should be recorded."					
3410	"When the ‘main condition’ recorded by the health care practitioner is a primary neoplasm and the ‘other condition’ is a secondary neoplasm (metastasis), code each neoplasm separately. Do not postcoordinate the stem code for primary neoplasm with the stem code for secondary neoplasm."					
3411	"When the main condition recorded by the health care practitioner is a secondary neoplasm (metastasis) and the primary neoplasm is no longer present (having been removed during a previous episode of care or where the documentation indicates a personal history of that neoplasm), code the secondary neoplasm (metastasis) as the main condition and separately code as an other condition the stem code for ‘personal history of’. Do not postcoordinate the stem code for secondary neoplasm with the stem code for ‘personal history of’. (See example below). Also, refer to Section 2.23.16 Coding ‘History of’ and ‘Family history of’ for further coding direction."					
3412	"When the main condition recorded by the health care practitioner is ‘Follow-up examination’ (a circumstance codable to Chapter 24 ‘Factors influencing health status or contact with health services’) and the ‘other condition’ recorded is a ‘personal history of’, code the applicable ‘follow-up examination’ code as the main condition and separately code the stem code for ‘personal history of’ as the other condition. Do not postcoordinate the ‘follow-up examination’ stem code with the stem code for ‘personal history of’. Refer to Section 2.23.16 Coding ‘History of’ and ‘Family history of’ for coding direction."					
3413	Example 1:					
3414	A patient is admitted for investigation of a lump in the breast. Investigation concludes a malignancy in the left breast. Mastectomy is performed and histopathology shows a spread to regional lymph nodes (left axilla). Chemotherapy is planned.					
3415	Main condition: Carcinoma of breast					
3416	Other condition: Metastases to regional lymph nodes					
3417	Procedure: Mastectomy					
3418	Code the main condition as malignant neoplasm in breast with optional extension code ‘left’ (2C6Z&XK8G). Cluster code secondary malignancy in axillary lymph nodes with optional extension code ‘left’ as other condition (2D60.3&XK8G).					
3419	Example 2:					
3420	Patient who has a history of carcinoma of breast resected two years ago is admitted for a bronchoscopy with biopsy. Investigation revealed secondary carcinoma in lung.					
3421	Main condition: Secondary carcinoma in lung					
3422	Other conditions: Carcinoma of breast resected two years ago					
3423	Procedure: Bronchoscopy with biopsy					
3424	"Code the main condition as [2D70 Malignant neoplasm metastasis in lung] . Code QC40.3 Personal history of malignant neoplasm of breast as another condition and postcoordinate the stem code 2C6Z Malignant neoplasms of breast, unspecified to specify the personal history is related to malignant primary breast cancer.

3425	Example 3:					
3426	Patient is admitted for bladder cancer recheck by cystoscopy. The patient has a history of previously excised bladder cancer. No evidence of recurrence seen.					
3427	Main condition: Follow-up examination by cystoscopy					
3428	Other conditions: History of bladder cancer					
3429	Procedure: Cystoscopy					
3430	"Code the main condition as [QA06 Follow-up examination after treatment for malignant neoplasm]. Option 1: Code [QC40.5 Personal history of malignant neoplasm of urinary tract].

3431	"Malignant neoplasms of multiple independent, primary sites"					
3432	"The stem code for Malignant neoplasms of independent (primary) multiple sites should be coded as the main condition when the health care practitioner records as the main condition two or more independent primary malignant neoplasms, none of which predominates. Then, optionally, additional codes to identify the individual neoplasms may be coded as other conditions to identify the individual primary malignant neoplasms recorded by the health care practitioner. Extension codes may be added to each primary malignant neoplasm stem code to identify additional detail of the histopathology and the site."					
3433	Example 1:					
3434	The documentation states that the patient has carcinomatosis of the peritoneum from an unknown primary neoplasm.					
3435	Main condition: Carcinomatosis of peritoneum					
3436	Code the main condition as 2D91 Malignant neoplasm metastasis in peritoneum. Code as another condition [2D4Z Unspecified malignant neoplasms of ill-defined or unspecified sites]. Main condition: 2D91 Other condition: 2D4Z

3441	Unspecified malignant neoplasms of ill-defined or unspecified sites					
3442	"This code should be used only when the health care practitioner has clearly recorded the neoplasm as an unknown primary site or as an unspecified malignancy, assumed primary."					
3443	"Malignant neoplasm metastases, unspecified site"					
3444	This code should be used as the main condition only when the malignancy is described as ‘disseminated metastases’ or ‘metastatic carcinoma’ (or other similar terms as described in the inclusion list of the code) but the specific sites are not documented.

3451	Diabetes mellitus					
3452	"When the health care practitioner has documented a condition as due to diabetes mellitus, postcoordinate the condition and the diabetes mellitus stem codes. If more than one condition is documented as being due to diabetes mellitus, each distinct clinical concept (each diabetes caused condition) is coded on its own and postcoordinated with the diabetes mellitus stem code even though it means repeating the diabetes code in each cluster. (Refer to Example 2 below)."

Codes from this chapter should not be assigned where an explanatory diagnosis is determined during the episode of care."					
3542	"2.23.21.13 Chapter 22: Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes"					
3543	"Where multiple injuries are recorded and no one of these has been selected as the ‘main condition’, code to one of the categories provided for statements of multiple injuries of:"					
3544	same type to the same body region;					
3545	different types to the same body region; and					
3546	same type to different body regions					
3547	and postcoordinate the stem codes that describe each individual injury.					
3548	Note the following exceptions:					
3549	"for internal injuries recorded with superficial injuries and/or open wounds only, code to internal injuries as the ‘main condition’;"					
3550	"for fractures of skull and facial bones with associated intracranial injury, code to the intracranial injury as the ‘main condition’;"					
3551	"for intracranial haemorrhage recorded with other injuries to the head only, code to intracranial haemorrhage as the ‘main condition’;"					
3552	"for fractures recorded with open wounds of the same location only, code to fracture as the ‘main condition’."					
3553	"When the multiple injury categories are used, codes for any individual injuries listed are used as additional codes in the same cluster."					
3554	Example 1:					
3555	"Patient suffered injuries to the bladder and urethra following an assault. Main condition: Injury to bladder and urethra Other conditions: - Code as main condition NB92.8 Injury of multiple pelvic organs and postcoordinate the stem codes for NB92.2Z Injury of bladder, unspecified and NB92.3Z Injury of urethra, unspecified as these codes are adding additional detail/specificity to NB92.8. Main condition cluster: NB92.8/NB92.2Z"					
3556	Example 2:					
3557	"Patient, who was the driver of a motorcycle, lost control on the highway and crashed. Investigations revealed open intracranial wound with cerebellar haemorrhage. Main condition: Open intracranial wound with cerebellar haemorrhage Other conditions: - Code the main condition NA0A.3 Multiple injuries of head and postcoordinate the stem codes for NA07.1 Traumatic intracerebral haemorrhage and NA07.Y Other specified intracranial injury. Main condition cluster: NA0A.3/NA07.1/NA07.Y"					
3558	2.23.21.14 Chapter 23: External causes of morbidity or mortality					
3559	"These codes are not to be used as ‘main condition’ codes. They are intended for use as additional codes to identify the external cause of conditions classified in Chapter 22 and may also be used as optional additional codes with conditions classified in any other chapter, but which have an external cause."					
3560	2.23.21.15 Chapter 24: Factors influencing health status or contact with health services					
3561	"There are some health care episodes that are not related to the treatment of or investigation for current illness or injury (e.g. monitoring of previously-treated conditions, immunisation visits, seeking of health-related advice). In such circumstances, a code for the main condition can potentially be found in Chapter 24 ‘Factors influencing health status and contact with health services’."					
3562	2.23.22 Traditional Medicine Conditions - Module 1 (TM1)					
3563	"Traditional Medicine (TM) is an integral part of health services provided in many countries. International standardisation by including Traditional Medicine conditions within the ICD allows for measuring, counting, comparing, formulating questions and monitoring its use over time. ICD-11’s supplementary chapter on Traditional Medicine disorders and patterns (TM1) is designed to be used in conjunction with the Western Medicine concepts of ICD Chapters 01-25."					
3564	"As with other ICD chapters, the TM1 chapter is a tool for classifying, diagnosing, counting, communicating and comparing TM conditions, it will also assist research and evaluation to assess the safety and efficacy of TM. This chapter not judging or endorsing TM practice or the efficacy of any TM intervention."					
3565	2.23.23 Use in Traditional Medicine					
3566	"Reporting at regional, national and international levels:"					
3567	Counting episodes of care for Traditional Medicine disorders and/or patterns in the same way as for Western Medicine diseases for morbidity data reporting purposes					
3568	Counting episodes of care by Traditional Medicine practitioners who may use a combination of Western Medicine and Traditional Medicine terminology					
3569	Describing and quantifying utilisation of Traditional Medicine services and reasons for encounter					
3570	Monitoring use of resources for Traditional Medicine services					
3571	"Standardising descriptions of disorders and patterns among TM clinicians, practitioners and coders"					
3572	Research:					
3573	Facilitating evidence-based research on safety and efficacy of Traditional Medicine interventions					
3574	Allowing clinical research within the Traditional Medicine framework and integrating Western Medicine with Traditional Medicine					
3575	Understanding interrelationships between Western Medicine diseases and Traditional Medicine disorders and patterns					
3576	Studying treatment patterns and outcomes for specific disorders and patterns using ICD-11 in conjunction with country specific procedure classifications and the TM component of the International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI)					
3577	Casemix reimbursement and insurance:					
3578	"There are precedents in China, Japan, and Korea for use of existing Traditional Medicine classifications (with or without Western Medicine concepts) for reimbursements to hospitals and for insurance claims and for clinical costing measures."					
3579	"Incorporating Traditional Medicine as a chapter of ICD-11 allows much greater scope for describing patient conditions (diseases, disorders (TM1) and patterns (TM1) across the Western Medicine and TM1 chapters) as well as complications and comorbidities."					
3580	Quality and safety of care:					
3581	"Standardising use of codes reflecting quality and safety of care between Western Medicine diseases and TM1 disorders will allow TM practitioners to interpret data from ICD-11 on quality, safety, and efficacy of care."					
3582	Education:					
3583	Educating TM practitioners in regard to standardisation of diagnosis					
3584	Educating TM clinicians and coders in application and interpretation of ICD-11 data.					
3585	Standardising terminology for use in electronic health records:					
3586	To enable more consistent and efficient recording and extraction of data					
3587	To allow computer assisted coding of TM1 disorders and patterns					
3588	2.23.24 Coding instructions for Traditional Medicine conditions - Module 1 (TM1)					
3589	"Codes from the Traditional Medicine chapter can be used across settings (hospital inpatient or ambulatory care in hospital or community) but must not be used for reporting cause of death. When coding in primary care, disorders and patterns may not be fully developed so that it may be more feasible to identify reason for encounter rather than main condition and associated conditions."					
3590	General principles:					
3591	"Consult all parts of the patient record including discharge summary, history, physical examination, investigations, laboratory data, treatments and final diagnoses."					
3592	Coding should relate to reasons for treatment during this episode and need not describe the whole patient’s lifetime history unless a past condition affects current care.					
3593	"Be as specific and explicit as possible, using codes to represent aetiology, pathology and manifestations of TM condition."					
3594	Use codes from relevant chapters of the ICD to match the clinical disorders noted on the patient record.					
3595	Code threatened TM conditions (i.e. those not well defined or not manifest).					
3596	"The inclusion of the supplementary chapter on Traditional Medicine conditions in ICD-11 aims to foster integration of TM into the health system. Hence, it is recommended that - wherever possible - TM1 codes should be used in conjunction with those from other ICD-11 chapters (Chapter 01-25) to enable comparison of Western medicine diagnosis and Traditional Medicine diagnosis."					
3597	The following generic coding scheme and alternative coding options can be used:					
3598	1. Read the patient summary and medical record.					
3599	"2. Select WM diagnosis/diagnoses, TM1 disorder(s) (TM1), and/or pattern(s) (TM1) to be coded."					
3600	Options	Examples	ICD-11 Coding Examples			
3601	a. WM diagnosis alone	Asthma	CA23.32			
3602	b. WM diagnosis with TM1 pattern	Asthma	CA23.32			
3603		Turbid phlegm accumulation in the lung pattern (TM1)	SF86			
3604	c. WM diagnosis with TM1 disorder	Asthma	CA23.32			
3605		Wheezing disorder (TM1)	SF81			
3606	You may choose more than one disorder (TM1) and more than one pattern (TM1) from the TM chapter.					
3607	3. Consult the electronic Coding Tool or relevant Alphabetic Indexes for WM and TM1 entries					
3608	4. Go to tabular list for the relevant code. Take note of inclusions and exclusion notes and textual descriptions.					
3609	5. Assign the appropriate code and follow any specific guidelines for that code.					
3610	"Applying the above listed generic coding scheme and alternative coding options for a given clinical picture must take into account the regulatory context, coding practice and setting specific requirements at country level. Additional coding conventions may be developed in response to country specific information needs (e.g. coding of main condition, use of extension codes, coding of neoplasms and injury, chronic and complicated conditions, sub-clinical or constitutional complaints, external cause of injury and adverse reaction)."					
3611	2.24 General statistical recommendations					
3612	2.24.1 Data quality					
3613	"To ensure high quality, processes for monitoring the quality of the coded data need to be implemented. This is referred to as Quality Assurance. On the following pages you will find some suggestions relating to the application of Quality Assurance for mortality and morbidity statistics. As a basic principle, those responsible for the collection and analysis of data should be involved in the development of the protocols for the processing and coding of the data, and in determination of the other data items to be cross-tabulated with them. Collecting quality data requires a clearly designed workflow (from reporting to coding to analysis), and adequate training of all involved parties. In particular, all participants need to understand the process and their part in it. The basic stages of the workflow include:"					
3614	"1. Documentation – This is where the information starts. Identifying a condition and then documenting it on a death certificate, in a medical record or on another medical form need to be carried out completely and accurately, using the best possible evidence. For this reason, this part of the workflow, should generally be carried out by a well-trained physician."					
3615	"2. Reporting – Documented information should be reported in the format specified by the responsible agencies. There may be differences in the required reporting structure, timeframe and obligations, depending on the country and/or data collection circumstances."					
3616	"3. Verification– Where unclear information, incomplete or illogical statements are reported, a feedback loop and return of queries to the certifiers and documenters should be used."					
3617	4. Grouping and analysis – Both serve to aggregate data in ways that are determined by the diverse use cases. Rules and constraints should be clearly understood and communicated when analysis is undertaken and results are reported and used.					
3618	2.24.2 Specificity versus ill-defined codes					
3619	"Reported information should be coded to the highest level of detail possible. In some instances, the details available are sparse, incompletely documented or only trivial details are reported. Though the ICD provides categories for these cases, such non-specific information does not allow understanding of epidemiological patterns and/or utilisation of health systems nor does it support prevention of disease."					
3620	2.24.3 Problems of a small population					
3621	"Population size is one of the factors that need to be considered when the health status of a population is assessed by means of mortality or morbidity data. In countries with small populations, the annual numbers of events in many categories will be very small and may fluctuate from year to year, especially when disaggregated by recommended age and sex. These problems can be alleviated through one or more of the following measures:"					
3622	"use or presentation of broad groupings of ICD rubrics, such as chapters"					
3623	"aggregation of data over a longer time period, e.g. to take the preceding two years of data together with those for the current year and produce a ‘moving average’ figure"					
3624	using the broadest possible age groupings					
3625	"The recommendations that apply for small national populations also hold true, in general, for reporting the data relating to subnational segments of larger populations. Investigations of health issues in population subgroups have to take into consideration the effect of the size of each of the subgroups on the type of analysis used. This need is generally recognised when dealing with sample surveys, but often overlooked when the investigation concerns the health problems of special groups in a national population."					
3626	2.24.4 ‘Empty cells’ and cells with low frequencies					
3627	"Regardless of the list of causes being used, it may be found that no cases for one or more listed cause(s) occur in certain cells in a statistical table. Where there are many empty lines in a table, it is worth considering the omission of such lines from a published table. When only the occasional case of a disease occurs in a country, the line can be regularly omitted from the published statistical table and a footnote added to indicate either that there were no cases in the reported timeframe or, when sporadic cases do occur, in which cell the case would have appeared. For cells with very low frequencies, especially those relating to diseases that would not be expected to occur, it is important to establish that the cases existed and did not result from a coding or processing error. This should be carried out as part of the general quality control of the data."					
3628	2.24.5 Precautions needed when tabulation lists include subtotals					
3629	"It may not always be apparent to those processing the data that some of the items in the tabulation lists are in fact subtotals or earlier reported categories. These items may include titles of blocks and titles of four- character categories or the items for chapter titles (in the condensed versions of the mortality tabulation lists). These entries should be ignored when totals are calculated, otherwise cases may be counted more than once."					
3630	2.24.6 Ethical Aspects					
3631	"Confidentiality refers to the obligation to not disclose information (data to third parties where that information has originally been delivered in confidence. This duty was codified in the Hippocratic Oath in the 4th century BCE and is still one of the core principles of medical ethics. Any information that might allow the identification of a specific person should only be viewed by people who are authorised to do so. Authorisation means that a person is legally permitted to access the information. e.g. medical staff, coroners and coders are all people who may be authorised to see sensitive information."					
3632	"Generally, the only way for confidential information to become publicly accessible is through legislation, statutes and regulations. Sometimes confidential information can become public record after a certain period of time. For instance, in some regions of the world the passage of time can render death certificates matters of public record and, therefore, the requirement for them to remain confidential no longer applies."					
3633	"The authorised supplier of confidential information must verify that the requesting person is an authorised user and determine their level of authorisation. The supplier must be aware of the level of information that can be made available to the authorised user and take appropriate steps to guard against unauthorised disclosure. The authorised user must not attempt to gain access to information which they are not authorised to obtain. Additionally, the user must also guard against unauthorised access to the information that has been supplied to them. This means that users must secure the confidential information and any recordings of that information in a way that prevents unauthorised access. The information must only be used for appropriate purposes and must be returned as required. National legal frameworks, state and local regulations, and institutional guidelines provide specific rules and information regarding how to maintain confidentiality."					
3634	2.24.7 Avoidance of Potential Harm					
3635	"Direct and serious harm can result from a breach of confidentiality. For example, the disclosure of sensitive information can potentially lead to stigma and discrimination against an individual. Conversely, greater harm can result from maintaining confidentiality than from not doing so. Some circumstances may require a judgement that involves balancing the harms to or disclosure against the interests of, the patient, deceased person and other relevant parties. A person may suffer ‘harm’ physically, socially or psychologically as a result of a breach of confidentiality. A confidential diagnosis that is breached makes the patient lose faith or trust in the clinician, and the patient may then suffer abuse from another person or suffer the stigma associated with certain conditions. In other circumstances the nondisclosure of one person’s confidential information may result in another individual or a community being at risk of developing a harmful condition or being exposed to a harmful situation."					
3636	"This is a difficult concept and one that must be approached in a thoughtful way. As previously mentioned, there are times when it is justifiable to give others confidential information, such as when reporting communicable disease incidence. In such cases the reporting of confidential information is usually allowed. This is an example of where the nondisclosure of a disease could result in major harm to others."					
3637	"If it is necessary to disclose information, it is preferable to contact the relevant person and let them know about the need to do so. In some cases, this may not be possible or appropriate, and users should be guided by legal and institutional guidelines. The harms that can be caused by disclosure of certain information must be considered. Some information that can be particularly sensitive includes tests for genetic disorders and diseases, incidence of communicable diseases, and HIV test results. Sometimes there are special requests for confidentiality that may require increased levels of confidentiality assurances. These special requests cannot supersede legal requirements for disclosure but should be respected when possible."					
3638	2.24.8 Security of Privacy – Confidentiality					
3639	"Privacy relates to protecting an individual’s control over what personal information and decisions may or may not be shared with others. For instance, when a physician examines or speaks with a patient it is usually done in a non-public area so that the information given to the physician by the patient cannot be heard by anyone else. It also enables the physician to give a patient their diagnosis in private. Data are shared with consent by the patient or where required by law or legislation. Security of privacy and confidentiality of health (and other) data are usually addressed by national laws and regulations."					
3640	2.25 Recommendations in relation to statistical tables for international comparison					
3641	The following recommendations aim to standardise the presentation of coded data to allow national and international comparisons between different countries or regions.					
3642	2.25.1 The recommended Special tabulation lists					
3643	"There are standard ways of listing causes coded according to the ICD, and there are formal recommendations concerning lists for tabulation that allow for national and international comparisons. The hierarchical structure of the ICD allows considerable flexibility for other possible tabulations. For mortality, the ICD includes special tabulation lists which are intended for circumstances in which the four-character list is too detailed, and are designed so that international comparison of significant diseases and groups of diseases is not compromised by different groupings used in different countries."					
3644	It should be noted that the special tabulation lists are designed for the aggregation and reporting of coded data. They are not for coding purposes.					
3645	The special tabulation lists are:					
3646	List 1 Mortality tabulation list					
3647	List 2 Morbidity tabulation list					
3648	List 3 International Shortlist for Hospital Morbidity Tabulation (ISHMT)					
3649	List 4 Infectious diseases by agent condensed list					
3650	List 5 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)					
3651	List 6 WHO Verbal autopsy list					
3652	The mortality list is based on the codes assigned for the underlying cause of death.					
3653	Morbidity list do not include codes from traditional medicine conditions.					
3654	Use of prefixes to identify the special tabulation lists					
3655	"Use of the numerical prefixes prevents confusion between the special tabulation lists, as the ICD four-character codes have a letter in the second position. Where an adapted list is used for national or sub-national purposes, an alternative identifying prefix should be used."					
3656	The special tabulation list for mortality					
3657	"The mortality tabulation list provides items for each ICD chapter and also, within most chapters, identify the items with residual items entitled ‘Remainder of…’ that complete the coverage of the respective chapter. The list covers the full range of ICD four-character codes applicable for mortality, required for reporting and publication purposes."					
3658	Locally designed lists for mortality					
3659	"For most countries, the mortality tabulation list provides enough information on the most important diseases and external causes of death. They also facilitate comparison over time and observation of shifts in the relative frequencies as health programmes take effect, of e.g. infectious diseases and degenerative diseases. It permits comparison between sub-national areas and population sub-groups. In addition, it makes meaningful international comparisons of causes of death possible."					
3660	"Lists similar to the special tabulation list can also be designed for local use. The ICD rubrics in such lists can be selected and grouped in any way. Special lists may be needed, for example, for monitoring progress, in terms of mortality and also morbidity, of many local health programmes. When adapting the special tabulation lists to national requirements, or when a tabulation list is being devised for a new or special project, a trial run is helpful by counting the number of cases for each four-character category. In such way, it can be determined which conditions are appropriate for broad grouping, and where subcategories are necessary."					
3661	"Where a local list is constructed, the key to the condensed categories should contain the same four- (or five-) character codes of the core classification."					
3662	The special tabulation list for morbidity					
3663	"The morbidity special tabulation list is intended as a basis for national lists and for intra- and inter-country comparison. National lists can be constructed by either condensing or expanding the core classification as appropriate. The list is suitable for data on inpatient care and, with suitable adaptation (notably through aggregation of some items and expansion of items relating to Chapter 21 ‘Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified’ and Chapter 24 ‘Factors influencing health status and contact with health services’) for information from other sources, such as ambulatory care and surveys."					
3664	"When a local list is constructed, the key to the condensed categories should contain the four (or five) character codes of the core classification. The list has been designed for international comparisons of hospital morbidity statistics. This concise list allows for comparison of hospital activity, independent of health systems. The conditions have been selected in a way that they can always be treated in an admission of at least 24 hours. If, after examination of the frequencies of the ICD four-character rubrics, it is necessary to expand the list, some of the items within ICD categories can be subdivided according to the core classification or even to the five-character level. If the recommended list is too detailed or if a shorter list is required, selection can be made based on national or local health concerns. Depending on a country’s ‘epidemiological profile’, categories may be combined to shorten the list."					
3665	2.25.2 International morbidity reporting					
3666	International morbidity reporting and comparison of data among different countries requires internationally agreed definitions of:					
3667	"inpatient, recoding of day-patients, outpatient"					
3668	hospital					
3669	treatment episode					
3670	reason for encounter used instead of diagnosis					
3671	See Section 1.4 for more detail.					
3672	2.25.2.1 Minimum data set and markup for postcoordination					
3673	"A minimum data set suitable for international comparison would include age, sex, main diagnosis, (reason for admission after assessment at the end of the stay), and health sector (hospital, practitioner, other), is ideally accompanied by the definitions in place for the variables mentioned above, and the main intervention. In an extended data set, ideally, additional diagnoses and interventions are reported in separate data fields. The markup for international reporting of postcoordinated codes in clusters will follow the specifications below:"					
3674	a slash ‘/’ separates 2 stem codes					
3675	an ‘&’ links stem codes with extension codes					
3676	a cluster may consist of a single code or One condition with additional detail in one cluster					
3677	stem code & extension code & extension code					
3678	Two unrelated conditions will have two clusters:					
3679	stem code - stem code					
3680	Two clusters with multiple codes:					
3681	stem code & extension code/stem code & extension code & extension code					
3682	Example 1:					
3683	Diabetes mellitus / Diabetic retinopathy					
3684	Example 2:					
3685	Multiple fractures of forearm / fracture of shaft of ulna & compound fracture / fracture of shaft of radius & compound fracture /external cause code					
3686	2.25.3 Presentation of statistical tables					
3687	"The degree of detail in cross-classification by cause, sex, age, and geographical area will depend both on the purpose and range of the statistical reportings and on the practical limits to their tabulation. The following patterns, which are designed to promote international compatibility, present standard ways of expressing various characteristics. Where a different classification is used in published tables (e.g. in age-grouping) it should be reducible to one of the recommended groupings."					
3688	"a. Analysis by the International Classification of Diseases should, as appropriate, be in accordance with:"					
3689	"the detailed list of four-character categories, with or without five-character subcategories;"					
3690	the special tabulation list for mortality;					
3691	the special tabulation list for morbidity.					
3692	b. Age classification for general purposes:					
3693	"under 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 5-year groups from 5 to 84 years, 85 years and over, 95 years and over;"					
3694	"under 1 year, 1-4 years, 5-14 years, 15-24 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, 45-54 years, 55-64 years, 65-74 years, 75 years and over."					
3695	"under 1 year, 1-14 years, 15-44 years, 45-64 years, 65 years and over."					
3696	"c. Classification by area should, as appropriate, be in accordance with:"					
3697	each major civil division;					
3698	"each town or conurbation of 1,000,000 population and over, otherwise the largest town with a population of at least 100,000;"					
3699	"a national aggregate of urban areas of 100,000 population and over;"					
3700	"a national aggregate of urban areas of less than 100,000 population;"					
3701	a national aggregate of rural areas.					
3702	Note 1. Statistics relating to (c) should include the definitions used to determine urban and rural.					
3703	"Note 2. In countries where medical certification of the cause of death is incomplete or limited to certain areas, figures for deaths not medically certified should be published separately."					
3704	2.25.3.1 Tabulation of causes of death					
3705	"Statistics of causes of death for a defined area should be in accordance with recommendation ‘Statistical tables’ (a)(1) above, or, if this is not possible, with recommendation ‘Statistical tables’ (a)(2)."					
3706	Deaths should preferably be classified by sex and age group as in recommendation ‘Statistical tables’ (b)(3).					
3707	"Statistics of causes of deaths for the areas in recommendation ‘Statistical tables’ (c) should comply with recommendation ‘Statistical tables’ (a)(2), or if this is not possible, with recommendation ‘Statistical tables’ (a)(3). They should preferably be tabulated by sex and age group as in recommendation ‘Statistical tables’ (b)(2)."					
3708	2.25.3.2 Injury mortality					
3709	Injury mortality traditionally distinguishes between injuries that are caused by:					
3710	Interpersonal violence and sexual abuse					
3711	"Collective violence including wars, civil insurrections and riots"					
3712	Traffic incidents					
3713	"Incidents at home, at work, and while participating in sports and other recreational activities"					
3714	"In the context of mortality, the WHO recommends the retention of codes for both main injury and external causes. In places where this is not feasible, the external cause code should be retained. For injury-related deaths, in ICD-11 the external cause code is the single underlying cause of death code, and incorporates the intent, mechanism, and object of the deceased in a single code. Place of occurrence and activity are coded separately."					
3715	2.25.4 Standards and reporting requirements for mortality in perinatal and neonatal periods					
3716	2.25.4.1 Terms used in perinatal and neonatal mortality					
3717	"The perinatal period commences at 22 completed weeks of gestation and ends 7 completed days after birth, i.e. includes days 0 – 6 after birth."					
3718	The neonatal period commences at birth and ends 28 completed days after birth i.e. includes days 0 – 27 after birth.					
3719	"Gestational age is the duration of gestation estimated based on the best obstetric estimate of gestation, which is usually expressed in completed weeks with additional days, or in completed days."					
3720	"The best obstetric estimate of gestation is based on the birth attendant’s final estimate of gestation, calculated from time elapsed since the first day of gestation. The first day of gestation is usually determined by:"					
3721	1. the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) 1 if confirmed by results of early ultrasound scan					
3722	"2. by early ultrasound scan, where LMP and results of early ultrasound scan differ"					
3723	"3. by LMP and/or the clinical postnatal estimate of gestational age, where no early ultrasound scan is available."					
3724	"In cases of assisted reproduction when the date of embryo transfer is known, an offset of 14 days is to be added for calculating gestational age."					
3725	"Gestational age is counted by calendar days where day zero (Day 0) is used to refer to the first calendar day of gestation and day 1 for the second calendar day. The first day of gestation i.e. day 0 corresponds to gestational age ‘zero completed weeks’ with zero additional days (gestational age 0+0 completed weeks), and 6 days later would be gestational age 0+6 completed weeks."					
3726	"The number of completed weeks is calculated as the number of days since the first day of gestation divided by 7, presented as a whole integer plus a remainder. For example, day 8 after gestation is 1+1 completed weeks, and day 252 corresponds to 36+0 completed weeks, and 6 days later (258 days) would be 36+6."					
3727	"Birthweight is the first weight of the fetus or neonate obtained after birth. For live births, birthweight should preferably be measured within the first hour of life before significant postnatal weight loss has occurred."					
3728	"Chronological age used in recording deaths in the neonatal period is counted as follows: Day 0 is used to refer to the first 24 hours after birth. Day 1, is the remainder of the 2nd calendar day (date of death=date of birth+1) but outside the 1st 24 hours. Day 2 is the 3rd calendar day (date of death=date of birth+2)."					
3729	"Where it is not feasible to capture information on hours at death, Day 0 should be considered to be the calendar day of birth (date of birth is equal to date of death), and subsequently: Day of death = Date of death - date of birth."					
3730	2.25.4.2 Definitions in perinatal and neonatal mortality					
3731	"Fetal death, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, live birth, neonatal death"					
3732	"Death in perinatal or neonatal period should be counted based on the time of delivery (i.e. a complete expulsion or extraction from a woman), though it may be diagnosed earlier in utero. Delivery of an embryo or fetus may occur either spontaneously, assisted or by caesarean section (i.e. it includes deliberate interruption of an ongoing pregnancy by medical or surgical means intended to result in a live birth), while it should be distinguished clearly from induced abortion."					
3733	"Fetal death is death of a fetus prior to its complete expulsion or extraction from a woman, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy."					
3734	Spontaneous abortion (also referred to as miscarriage) is a spontaneous loss of pregnancy (i.e. embryo or fetus) before 22 completed weeks of gestation.					
3735	"Stillbirth is the complete expulsion or extraction from a woman of a fetus, following its death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction, at 22 or more completed weeks of gestation."					
3736	"Live birth is the complete expulsion or extraction from a woman of a fetus, irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy, which, after such separation, shows signs of life."					
3737	Neonatal death is a death after live birth which occurs during the neonatal period.					
3738	"Death of an embryo or fetus may be diagnosed in utero by absence of heart sounds, confirmed by imaging techniques where available, or after the complete expulsion or extraction from a woman by absence of signs of life. Signs of life at birth include breathing, beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord and definite movement of voluntary muscles whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached. Fleeting reflex activity observed only in the first minute after birth does not warrant classification as a sign of life."					
3739	Notes for national and international reporting (See also 2.25.4.5):					
3740	"Definitions and reporting criteria concerning the lower limit for fetal deaths or spontaneous abortions may differ depending on different national legislation (generally medically recognised embryonic period of gestation lasts until the 12th completed week, however another national legal limit could be set at fetus of for example 11 or 13 weeks). Any lower limit should be specified in the statistics produced."					
3741	"It is recommended to produce statistics for all fetal deaths and all deaths following live births, while reporting criteria may differ depending on different national legislation."					
3742	For international reporting it is recommended to report stillbirths of 28 or more completed weeks of gestation (late stillbirth) and all deaths following live birth. Countries with ability for reporting stillbirths of 22 or more completed weeks of gestation (early stillbirth) are recommended to do so.					
3743	"When information on gestational age is unavailable for spontaneous abortion or stillbirth, use birthweight less than 500 grams as the criteria."					
3744	Artificial termination of pregnancy					
3745	"Artificial termination of pregnancy is a complete expulsion or extraction from a woman of an embryo or a fetus (irrespective of the duration of the pregnancy), following a deliberate interruption of an ongoing pregnancy by medical or surgical means, which is not intended to result in a live birth."					
3746	"Artificial termination of an ongoing pregnancy is regulated by law and may be referred to as either legal abortion, induced abortion, fetal reduction or other terminologies. As long as it meets the definition of artificial termination of pregnancy it should be considered separately from spontaneous abortion or stillbirth and clearly distinguishable in the statistics."					
3747	"Whilst transient signs of life may be evident after some cases of artificial termination of pregnancy at later gestational weeks, these should never be coded as spontaneous abortion or live births."					
3748	2.25.4.3 Other terminologies used in recording and presentation of perinatal or neonatal mortality					
3749	"Fetal death (i.e. regardless of gestational age; lower limit, if any, should be stated)"					
3750	"Antepartum fetal death is a fetal death before the onset of labour. If vital status of the fetus at the onset of labour is unknown, consider it was antepartum if there is presence of signs of maceration at the time of delivery."					
3751	"Intrapartum fetal death is a fetal death during labour. If vital status of the fetus at the onset of labour is unknown, consider it was intrapartum if there is fresh skin appearance or no signs of maceration at the time of delivery."					
3752	Stillbirth (i.e. 22 or more completed weeks)					
3753	Early stillbirth is stillbirth of 22-27 completed weeks of gestation.					
3754	Late stillbirth is stillbirth of 28 or more completed weeks of gestation.					
3755	Antepartum stillbirth is stillbirth following antepartum fetal death (i.e. occurring before onset of labour).					
3756	Intrapartum stillbirth is stillbirth following intrapartum fetal death (i.e. occurring during labour).					
3757	Macerated stillbirth is stillbirth with presence of signs of maceration at the time of delivery.					
3758	Fresh stillbirth is stillbirth with fresh skin appearance and no signs of maceration at the time of delivery.					
3759	Period of gestation					
3760	Preterm is less than 37 completed weeks (less than 259 days) of gestation.					
3761	Term is from 37 completed weeks to less than 42 completed weeks (259 to 293 days) of gestation.					
3762	Post-term is 42 completed weeks or more (294 days or more) of gestation.					
3763	Birthweight					
3764	Extremely low birthweight is a birthweight less than 1000 g (up to and including 999 g).					
3765	Very low birthweight is a birthweight less than 1500 g (up to and including 1499 g).					
3766	Low birthweight is a birthweight less than 2500 g (up to and including 2499 g).					
3767	Large birthweight is a birthweight of 4000 g or more and less than 4500 g (up to and including 4499 g).					
3768	Exceptionally large birthweight is a birthweight of 4500 g or more.					
3769	Neonatal death					
3770	An early neonatal death is a death during the first 7 completed days after live birth (days 0 - 6)					
3771	A neonatal death is a death during the first 28 completed days after live birth (days 0-27)					
3772	Total birth					
3773	"Total birth is the total of stillbirth and live birth. If the lower limit of stillbirth is set different from 22 weeks, for example at 28 weeks for international reporting, this should be clearly stated."					
3774	2.25.4.4 Certification of stillbirth and live births in the neonatal period					
3775	"The reliability of the mortality estimates related to children depends on accuracy and completeness of recording and reporting of births and deaths. A death certificate should be issued for all fetal deaths regardless of its occurrence being spontaneous or deliberate, and for all neonatal deaths following live births."					
3776	"Under-reporting and misclassification are common, especially for stillbirths and early neonatal deaths. Countries should arrange registration and reporting procedures so that the events and the criteria for their inclusion in the statistics can be easily identified."					
3777	"Data of fetal deaths meeting requirements for stillbirth registration should be included in mortality statistics, but should be clearly distinguishable from neonatal deaths following live births. Follow instructions in 2.25.4.5 for details, when it is not clear whether the certificate relates to a stillbirth or a neonatal death following live birth."					
3778	"Artificial termination of pregnancy should also be included in mortality statistics, but should be clearly distinguishable from spontaneous abortion or stillbirths."					
3779	The international form of medical certificate of cause of death and additional details					
3780	"With the update of the International form of medical certificate of cause of death in 2016, just one certificate is used for all cases including stillbirths (see 2.15. Care needs to be taken to correctly fill in the specific section for perinatal deaths on the certificate. The previously recommended perinatal death certificate should be replaced by the form in 2.15, and perinatal deaths should be coded according to the general mortality coding instructions."					
3781	"While not required for ICD-11 coding, the additional information mentioned in 2.15 might be helpful for the monitoring of perinatal and infant deaths of a country or region."					
3782	Level of details for recording					
3783	Gestational age and birthweight should be recorded for all live births and stillbirths to the degree of accuracy to which it is measured.					
3784	"The gestational age should be recorded in number of completed weeks as a minimum, and where possible an additional variable capturing the number of days should also be included."					
3785	"While statistical tabulations include 500 g groupings for birthweight, weights should not be recorded in those groupings. The actual weight should be recorded to the degree of accuracy to which it is measured."					
3786	"Chronological age at death during the first 24 hours of life (day 0) should be recorded in units of completed minutes or hours of life. For the second (day 1), third (day 2) and through 27 completed days of life, age at death should be recorded in days. It is recommended that these data are collected as part of a minimal perinatal dataset."					
3787	"2.25.4.5 Reporting criteria for fetal death, stillbirth and live birth"					
3788	"As a minimum all stillbirths and deaths following live births born with 22 or more completed weeks of gestation (≥ 154 days) should be included in the statistics, though the legal requirements for the registration may vary depending on different national legislations."					
3789	"When information on gestational age is not available, the corresponding criteria for birthweight (500g or more) should be used."					
3790	"Where gestational age and birthweight are not known, for example when only crown-heel length or estimated gestational age based on physical examination is available, or when no such information is available, the event should be included in, rather than excluded from, mortality statistics of the perinatal period."					
3791	"Where fetal deaths and/or neonatal deaths at <22 completed weeks of gestation (or <500g) are included in perinatal statistics these should be presented separately from stillbirths and/or neonatal deaths at 22 or more completed weeks of gestation and the lower limit for inclusion in perinatal statistics in the setting should be stated, for example ‘20 completed weeks of gestation’ or ‘no lower gestational age limit’."					
3792	"Note that the reporting criteria above do not apply to artificial termination of pregnancy, which is defined irrespective of duration of pregnancy and should be presented separately from fetal death, stillbirth or live birth."					
3793	Criteria for international reporting					
3794	"In statistics for international comparison, inclusion of fetal deaths and live births born at extremely low gestational ages disrupts the validity of comparisons and is not recommended. Therefore, the criteria for international reporting of stillbirths and/or neonatal deaths are set at 28 completed weeks or more, while countries are encouraged to provide, where possible, data from 22 completed weeks or more as well."					
3795	Table 1					
3796	Gestational age (completed weeks)	Birthweight (grams)	Recommendations for registration of data			
3797	<22 (very early gestation)	<500	"Only required for neonatal mortality national statistics. When used for spontaneous abortion (miscarriages), should be reported separately from perinatal statistics and the lower gestational age limit for data collection stated."			
3798	22-27 (early gestation)	500 or more	"For national statistics, and for international statistics of countries with ability for reporting of early gestation deaths (stillbirths and neonatal mortality)"			
3799	28 or more (late gestation)	1000 or more	For international statistics (stillbirths and neonatal mortality)			
3800	Unknown gestational age	Unknown birthweight	Include in statistics only when there is a high likelihood that the stillbirth or neonatal death occurred at the given criteria e.g. 28 or more weeks for international statistics.			
3801	"2.25.4.6 Statistical presentation of perinatal, neonatal, infant or under-five mortality"					
3802	"For perinatal mortality statistics, full-scale multiple- cause analysis of all conditions reported will be of the greatest value."					
3803	Countries should provide the rates listed below for international comparisons:					
3804	Late stillbirth rate = (stillbirths ≥ 28 weeks gestation/total births (stillbirths ≥ 28 weeks gestation and live births) x 1000					
3805	Early neonatal mortality rate = (early neonatal deaths (day 0-6) ≥ 28 weeks gestation /live births ≥ 28 weeks gestation) x 1000					
3806	Perinatal mortality rate = (stillbirths ≥ 28 weeks gestation and early neonatal deaths (day 0-6) ≥ 28 weeks gestation) /total births (stillbirths ≥ 28 weeks gestation and live births) x 1000

3824	"Under 1 hour, 1–11 hours, 12–23 hours"					
3825	2.25.4.7 Under-five mortality					
3826	"Under-5 mortality (Under-5 mortality rate – probability of dying between birth and exactly 5 years of age, expressed per 1,000 live births.) is a leading indicator of the level of child health, quality of life, health infrastructure, and overall development in countries. It is also the SDG indicator."					
3827	2.25.4.8 Infant mortality					
3828	"Infant mortality (infant mortality rate – probability of dying between birth and exactly 1 year of age, expressed per 1,000 live births) is an indicator for quality of life and health infrastructure."					
3829	2.25.5 Standards and reporting requirements related for maternal mortality					
3830	Maternal mortality is part of the assessment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that serve to monitor the impact of the joint work of the international community in this field.					
3831	2.25.5.1 Maternal death					
3832	"A maternal death is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes."					
3833	2.25.5.2 Late Maternal death					
3834	"A late maternal death is defined as: the death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric causes, more than 42 days but less than one year after termination of pregnancy."					
3835	2.25.5.3 Comprehensive maternal death					
3836	A grouping that combines maternal death and late maternal death.					
3837	2.25.5.4 Direct and indirect obstetric deaths					
3838	"Maternal deaths, late maternal deaths, and comprehensive maternal deaths are subdivided into two groups:"					
3839	"Direct obstetric deaths: those resulting from obstetric complications of the pregnant state (pregnancy, labour, and puerperium), and from interventions, omissions, incorrect treatment, or from a chain of events resulting from any of the above."					
3840	"Indirect obstetric deaths: those resulting from previously existing disease or disease that developed during pregnancy, and that were not due to direct obstetric causes but were aggravated by the physiologic effects of pregnancy."					
3841	"2.25.5.5 Death occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium"					
3842	"A death occurring during pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium is defined as: the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death (direct and indirect obstetric and non-obstetric death)."					
3843	2.25.5.6 Recording requirements of maternal mortality					
3844	"In order to improve the quality of maternal mortality data and provide alternative methods of collecting data on deaths during pregnancy or related to pregnancy, as well as to encourage the recording of deaths from obstetric causes occurring more than 42 days following termination of pregnancy, the Forty-third World Health Assembly in 1990 adopted the recommendation that countries consider including questions regarding current pregnancy and pregnancy within one year preceding death on death certificates."					
3845	The classification also allows the recording of deaths that occur one year or more after termination of the pregnancy (JB62 Death from sequelae of obstetric causes).					
3846	2.25.5.7 International reporting of maternal mortality					
3847	"For the purpose of international reporting of maternal mortality, only those maternal deaths occurring before the end of the 42-day reference period should be included in the calculation of the various ratios and rates, although the recording of later deaths is useful for national analytical purposes."					
3848	"2.25.5.8 Numerator, denominator, and ratios of published maternal mortality"					
3849	"Published maternal mortality ratios should always specify the numerator, which can be given as the number of recorded direct obstetric deaths, or the number of recorded obstetric deaths (direct plus indirect). Note that cases not coded to Chapter 18 should also be included in the numerator. These include those categories presented in the ‘Exclusion Note’ at the beginning of Chapter 18, provided that they have been aggravated by pregnancy or conversely aggravated the pregnancy."					
3850	"The denominator used for calculating maternal mortality should be specified as either the number of live births or the number of total births (live births plus fetal deaths). Where both denominators are available, a calculation should be published for each."					
3851	"Results should be expressed as a ratio of the numerator over the denominator, multiplied by k (where k may be 1000, 10,000 or 100,000, as preferred and indicated by the country). Maternal mortality ratios and rates can thus be expressed as follows:"					
3852	1. Maternal mortality ratio: (Maternal deaths/Live births or total births) x k					
3853	2. Direct obstetric mortality ratio: (Direct obstetric death only/Live births or total births) x k					
3854	"Ratio for death occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium: (Deaths occurring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium/Live births) x k"					
3855	3 Part 3 - New in ICD-11					
3856	3.1 ICD-11 new conventions and terminology					
3857	"Table 1: Major changes from ICD-10 to ICD-11, including rationale"					
3858	ICD-10	ICD-11				
3859	Coding Scheme					
3860	Chapter numbering is roman numerals	Chapter numbering is Arabic				
3861	"Three-character categories, each of which can be further divided into up to 10 four-character subcategories."	Stem code (category) is four characters and there are two levels of subcategories				
3862	"Alphanumeric code with a letter in the first position and a number in the second, third and fourth positions. The fourth character follows a decimal point."	An alphanumeric code with a letter in the second position and number in the third character position to differentiate from the codes of ICD-10. The inclusion of a forced number at the third character position prevents spelling ‘undesirable words’. A letter in the second character position allows for clear distinction between a code from ICD-11 and one from ICD-10. Alphanumeric codes cover the range from 1A00.00 to ZZ9Z.ZZ. Codes starting with an ‘X’ indicate an extension code (see Extension code chapter). The letters ‘O’ and ‘I’ are omitted to prevent confusion with the numbers ‘0’ and ‘1’.				
3863	"The first character of a code is a letter and does not relate to the chapter number. The letter may have been the same for two short chapters (e.g. Chapter VII (H00-H5) and Chapter VIII (H60-H95), or two letters may have been used for one long chapter (e.g. Chapter XIX (S00-T98))."	"The first character of the code always relates to the chapter. A first character of 1-9 is used for chapters 01 through 09 and for chapters 10 through 26, the first character is a letter. The code range of a single chapter always has the same character in the first position. For example, 1A00 is a code in chapter 01, and BA00 is a code in chapter 11."				
3864	Residual category identified by numeric character .8 and unspecified category identified by numeric character .9.	The terminal letter ‘Y’ is reserved for the residual category ‘other specified’ and the terminal letter ‘Z’ is reserved for the residual category ‘unspecified’.				
3865	Code cluster concept does not exist in ICD-10.	ICD-11 supports postcoordination and the linking codes within a code cluster.				
3866	Terminology					
3867	a range of expressions are used to describe a causal relationship between conditions in a code title	"The preferred term is ‘due to’ for categories where two conditions are mentioned and causal sequence exists. Other terms, such as ‘caused by’; or ‘attributed to’ may be allowed synonyms. The phrase ‘secondary to’ is equivalent and may also be included as a synonym."				
3868	a range of expressions indicating the concurrence of two conditions in a code title (e.g. ‘in’ or ‘with’).	The preferred term is ‘associated with’ for categories where two conditions are mentioned and there is no causal sequence implied.				
3869	Dagger-Asterisk system and additional sub-classifications					
3870		ICD-10	ICD-11			
3871	Dagger asterisk system	"ICD-10 (and ICD-9) used the dagger asterisk system to describe the aetiological condition for primary tabulation (dagger code) and the clinical manifestation, relevant site and or other aspects (asterisk code). In addition, there were sets of codes to be used to add more detail (e.g. B95-B97) or lists of sub-classifications to add anatomical detail to categories."	"The ICD-11 equivalents of asterisk codes (i.e. codes for manifestations) and other codes that served to add detail, may be found in Chapter 21 ‘Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified’, the Chapter X ‘Extension codes’ chapter or in a body system chapter as appropriate. The extension codes include chapter groups anatomy, agents, histopathology and other aspects that may be used to add detail to a code."			
3872	Use of multiple codes for one condition/additional sub-classifications	"More than one category could be used to specify more detail for another category. For example, infectious agents (B95-B97) or the asterisk codes."	Postcoordination - The use of multiple codes (i.e. stem codes and/or extension codes) together to fully describe a documented clinical concept.			
3873	‘Code also’ instruction’	"‘Use additional code, if desired, to identify’ notes were present to suggest optional coding."	"‘Code also’ instructions inform about additional information that needs to be coded in conjunction with certain categories, because that additional information is relevant for primary tabulation"			
3874	"The dagger and asterisk system has been removed in ICD-11, but the functionality of coding the aetiology and manifestation remains. A number of former asterisk codes that were previously used to identify manifestations of diseases are now listed in Chapter 21 ‘Symptoms, signs, or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified’. A portion of former asterisk codes also reside in the corresponding body system chapter. Asterisk codes that were repetitions of the dagger code were removed. Lists for coding optional anatomical detail have been grouped into one section in Chapter X ‘Extension codes’."					
3875	Other general differences					
3876		ICD-11				
3877	Category description	"All ICD-11 categories have a short and a long description. The short description describes the meaning of the category in 100 words or less and appears in the printed version of the classification. The long description is without length restriction, including detailed information that appears in the content model."				
3878	Content model	"All ICD-11 categories include separate information on anatomy, aetiology and other aspects that can be accessed for search purposes, or when browsing in the tabular list of the ICD-11 MMS."				
3879	"Special tabulation lists of ICD-10 continue to exist, but there are two additional ones, the Startup Mortality List (SMoL) and the list for verbal autopsy. Additional special tabulations can be derived from the new multiple parenting technique, e.g. all WHO notifiable diseases, listing all conditions that are assigned to the relevant section of the infectious diseases chapter."					
3880	"For morbidity, the definition of main diagnosis has changed to be ‘the reason for admission, after assessment at the end of the stay’. This definition is less prone to interpretation, and countries that had switched from the ‘most resource intensive’ definition to the ‘reason for admission at the end of the stay’ using ICD-10, noticed only small changes in their activity statistics."					
3881	3.1.1 Short Description					
3882	The description is a short characterisation (maximum of 100 words) of the entity that states things that are always true about a disease or condition and necessary to understand the scope of the rubric. Descriptions do not contain elements intended for use in level 3 (common epidemiology) or things that may be true for level 4 (clinical criteria). Descriptions were formerly called ‘short definitions’.					
3883	3.1.2 Additional Information					
3884	"This is a text field that is not mandatory, but that may contain any additional information about, or characteristics of, the diseases or conditions included in the entity. This text field provides more context for the entity. For example, the most common epidemiologic circumstances, putative or highly suspected aetiologic agents, or other information that may not always be true but may be common, typical, or expected. Additional information was formally called ‘long definition’."					
3885	3.1.3 Code Structure					
3886	The codes of the ICD–11 are alphanumeric and cover the range from 1A00.00 to ZZ9Z.ZZ. Codes starting with ‘X’ indicate an extension code (see Extension codes). The inclusion of a forced number at the third character position prevents spelling ‘undesirable words’. A letter in the second character position allows for clear distinction between a code from ICD–11 and one from ICD–10. For further information refer to					
3887	3.2 Chapter Structure of ICD-11					
3888	"The international core reference linearisation is the ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics (ICD-11MMS). It is used for coding and reporting illnesses or causes of death for international comparison. The naming of this linearisation highlights its two main use cases. This core linearisation is divided into 28 chapters, of which 25 refer to health conditions similar to past ICD versions, while one serves to identify external causes of morbidity and mortality, and another includes concepts of traditional medicine. Lastly, there are two additional sections for optional additional use, one for extension codes to add more detail for different dimensions of a disease, such as anatomy, mark a condition to be present on admission, or a disease having been relevant in the family history (see Section [Extension Codes]) and the other for functioning assessment to provide a set of codes for assessment and scoring in the ICD using ICF functioning domains of high explanatory power (see Section 3.2.27 Section V – Supplementary section for functioning assessment)."					
3889	"ICD–11 has five new chapters. As a result, the numbering of the chapters has changed. The new chapters are:"					
3890	Chapter 03 ‘Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs’ and Chapter 04 ‘Diseases of the immune system’. Conditions affecting the immune system’ and conditions affecting the blood are now in two separate chapters.					
3891	Chapter 07 ‘Sleep-Wake disorders’. Sleep wake disorders have been regrouped together in this new chapter.					
3892	Chapter 17 ‘Conditions related to sexual health’. Sexual conditions have been grouped together in this new chapter.					
3893	Chapter 26 ‘Supplementary Chapter Traditional Medicine Conditions - Module I’. A chapter for traditional medicine has been added.					
3894	The following is an overview of the organisational principles and classification structure (hierarchy) for each of the 26 chapters. The revised structure and new sets of functionalities in ICD-11 were the result of incorporating scientific updates and making the classifications more relevant for computerisation.					
3895	3.2.1 Chapter 01 – Certain infectious or parasitic diseases					
3896	Structure of Chapter 01					
3897	3.2.1.1 Chapter 01 – Structure of chapter 01					
3898	"The chapter first lists infectious disease groupings by clinical syndromes, then groups other infections by mode of transmission, and then lists the remaining infections by their agent. Some conditions of major public health concern are listed at the same level. Variants to the conditions in the chapter that occasionally can occur as localised infections are primarily coded to this chapter. Infections that are primarily localised, and where the agent usually is either unknown, or not relevant, or there is a mixed aetiology, reside in the organ chapters. Frequent infectious agents may be listed as individual child categories under the localised infection. In some instances, infections could equally be located in the infectious disease chapter and in an organ system chapter. In such cases, the decision that creates the least change (ICD-10 legacy) has been chosen. Some grouping is also designed to be able to code frequently reported imprecise information, as is the case for meningitis and encephalitis and respiratory infections."					
3899	A special tabulation list groups the infections by agents and is intended for special tabulation and reporting only.					
3900	3.2.1.2 Chapter 01 – Rationale for chapter 01					
3901	"The purpose of the structure of chapter 01 is to minimise the impact on longitudinal statistics of major infections, to allow reporting of main infections that have a common lead symptom (e.g. diarrhoea) without mention of a specific agent. Influenza, though visibly affecting the respiratory tract, affects multiple parts of the body and is also of important public health concern. For that reason, it has been moved into the infectious chapter. Prion diseases can be transmissible, genetic or arise spontaneously. They are rare conditions that only affect the nervous system. Many are inherited. The presence of a specific gene is a prerequisite to developing a prion disease. In view of these facts, it was decided to keep the prion diseases grouped together and move the whole group to the neurology chapter."					
3902	3.2.1.3 Antimicrobial resistance					
3903	"The ICD parts relating to Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) have been designed to support the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System. Priority pathogens are identified in combinations with currently relevant antimicrobial substances. The section is designed to allow postcoordination of other substance and agent combinations in a cluster. The section on AMR is located in Chapter 21 ‘Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified’, so that the underlying disease or agent is always coded in conjunction with the AMR category. ICD and the surveillance system focus on specific tracer pathogen-substance combinations. However, ICD design allows the coding of the full antibiotic susceptibility pattern if desired. For tabulation, the AMR codes should be reported in combination with the infectious disease. Where only one condition can be reported, the infectious disease should be retained. However, at the national level, the set of infectious diseases and the number of AMR cases among the infection cases should be tabulated."					
3904	3.2.2 Chapter 02 – Neoplasms					
3905	3.2.2.1 Chapter 02 – Structure of chapter 02					
3906	The general hierarchy of Chapter 02 consists of the following:					
3907	1st level - Behaviour					
3908	2nd level - Broad sites or systems					
3909	3rd level - Specific site					
3910	4th level - Morphological (histological) type					
3911	There are three groups that are an exception to the above hierarchy. They are:					
3912	1. Neoplasms of brain and central nervous system					
3913	1st level - Broad sites					
3914	2nd level - Behaviour - morphological (histological) type					
3915	2. Neoplasms of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues					
3916	1st level - Broad morphological (histological) type					
3917	2nd level - Specific morphological (histological) type					
3918	3. Malignant mesenchymal neoplasms					
3919	1st level - Specific morphological (histological) type					
3920	2nd level - Site					
3921	3.2.2.2 Chapter 02 - Rationale for Chapter 02					
3922	"The progress in oncology has clearly demonstrated that a site-only based categorisation of malignant and benign tumours provides limited information for prevention, treatment, and prognosis for persons that are affected by a tumour. ICD–10 included a limited number of categories based on histopathology (e.g. some lymphoid neoplasms, melanoma)."					
3923	"In ICD–11, main tumour sites have subdivisions of histopathology first. The groups chosen were based on an analysis of international mortality and morbidity reporting, cancer registries, and clinical reporting. The redesigned sections were reviewed for missing details in relation to the ICD use cases."					
3924	"Keeping the main anatomical axes intact allows backwards compatibility. However, the structure was adjusted in a few places to match anatomical subdivisions of the TNM classification (https://www.uicc.org/resources/tnm)."					
3925	"For tumours of the central nervous system, the histological and behavioural distinction between benign and malignant is a grey area. As such, it was decided to move all central nervous system tumours outside the basic framework of behaviour and group them together."					
3926	"The field of genetic markers is rapidly changing. Whereas for some tumours, such markers have been used for many years, for others, this is not the case. As such, with the exception of haematological tumours, genetic markers were not included, and have not been used for the classification. They are, however, included in Chapter X ‘Extension codes’, and can be added as postcoordination to the relevant code from the neoplasms chapter to describe the relevant tumour entity fully."					
3927	3.2.3 Chapter 03 – Diseases of the blood or blood-forming organs					
3928	3.2.3.1 Chapter 03 – Structure of chapter 03					
3929	This new chapter (previously part of Chapter III in ICD-10) has three main sections:					
3930	- Anaemias or other erythrocyte disorders					
3931	"- Coagulation defects, purpura or other haemorrhagic or related conditions"					
3932	- Diseases of spleen					
3933	"Neoplasms of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues are primarily located in Chapter 02 ‘Neoplasms’ while Symptoms, signs or clinical findings of blood or blood-forming organs or the immune system are primarily located in Chapter 21."					
3934	The first two major sections comprise of the following hierarchy:					
3935	1st level - Anaemias and coagulation disorders					
3936	2nd level - Broad category of disease/disorder type					
3937	3rd level - Congenital vs acquired					
3938	4th level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
3939	The third major section comprises of the following hierarchy:					
3940	1st level - Diseases of spleen					
3941	2nd level - Congenital vs acquired					
3942	3rd level - Specific disease/disorder type					
3943	3.2.3.2 Chapter 03 – Rationale for chapter 03					
3944	"For Chapter 03, there has been a reorganisation of the chapter into a clinical view of diseases of the blood, an aetiological view of diseases of the blood and diseases of the spleen. Anaemias are now all under one group with a separate group for ‘Coagulation defects, purpura or other haemorrhagic correlated conditions’."					
3945	3.2.4 Chapter 04 – Diseases of the immune system					
3946	3.2.4.1 Chapter 04 – Structure of chapter 04					
3947	This new chapter (previously part of Chapter III in ICD-10) has the following sections:					
3948	Immunodeficiencies					
3949	Non-organic specific systemic disorders					
3950	1st level - Being the main groupings above					
3951	2nd level - Broad category of disease/disorder type					
3952	3rd level - Specific disease/disorder type					
3953	4th level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
3954	1st level - Autoinflammatory disorders					
3955	2nd level - Specific syndrome					
3956	1st level - Allergic or hypersensitivity conditions					
3957	2nd level - Broad category for body systems					
3958	1st level - Certain diseases involving the immune system					
3959	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type					
3960	3rd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
3961	Diseases of thymus					
3962	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type					
3963	3.2.4.2 Chapter 04 – Rationale for chapter 04					
3964	"For Chapter 04, there are new sections for immune disorders that differ from the section previously located in Chapter III of ICD–10. For the immune system they are classified mainly by clinical syndrome, and in an alternate view the immune system conditions are shown by cell line. A section for Allergic or hypersensitivity conditions has been included in this chapter. Overall, more detail has been added to the chapter."					
3965	"3.2.5 Chapter 05 – Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases"					
3966	3.2.5.1 Chapter 05 – Structure of Chapter 05					
3967	Chapter 05 has four major sections:					
3968	1. Endocrine diseases					
3969	2nd level - Specific gland or hormone system					
3970	3rd level - Specific diseases/disorder					
3971	2. Nutritional disorders					
3972	2nd level - Broad categories of diseases/disorder					
3973	3rd level - Specific disease/disorder					
3974	3. Metabolic disorders					
3975	2nd level – Broad categories of diseases/disorder					
3976	3rd level - Specific disease/disorder					
3977	4. Postprocedural endocrine or metabolic disorders					
3978	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder					
3979	"Neoplasms of the endocrine system are primarily located in Chapter 02 ‘Neoplasms’ and Symptoms, signs or clinical findings of endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases are primarily located in Chapter 21."					
3980	3.2.5.2 Chapter 05 – Rationale for Chapter 05					
3981	There is increased international standardisation of endocrine disease terminology being used to describe the complex nature of endocrine conditions. The intent is to include all dysfunctions that lead to a specific endocrine disorder.					
3982	Diabetes mellitus and Intermediate hyperglycaemia have been expanded to reflect current international terminology. The complications often associated with diabetes have continued to be included in the classification in the appropriate body system chapter in line with the various clinical modifications. ‘Code also’ and ‘Use additional code’ notes have been included to link the types of diabetes and the various complications to enable the addition of codes for further specificity.					
3983	"Sources of change for this section were based on the current WHO Classification of Diabetes Mellitus and Intermediate Hyperglycaemia 2011 and the Department of Chronic Diseases, Health Promotion, WHO."					
3984	"The WHO Department of Nutrition for Health and Development proposed changes to the section on Nutritional Disorders with advice from the Nutrition Guidance Expert Advisory Group (NUGAG) for updates to this section of the classification. Metabolic disorders are now aetiologically based and have been classified into three distinct areas; ‘Inborn errors of metabolism’, ‘Disorders of metabolite absorption and transport’ and ‘Disorders of fluid, electrolyte and acid-base balance’ following clinical advice received from the relevant international societies for metabolic diseases."					
3985	"3.2.6 Chapter 06 – Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders"					
3986	3.2.6.1 Chapter 06 – Structure of Chapter 06					
3987	The hierarchy of Chapter 06 consists of:					
3988	1st level - Broad category of disease/disorder type					
3989	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type					
3990	3rd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
3991	3.2.6.2 Chapter 06 – Rationale for Chapter 06					
3992	"The overall linear structure of the proposed Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders chapter for ICD–11 has been a topic of substantive and comprehensive discussions by the Topic Disorders Advisory Group for Mental Health, as well as extensive interactions with the American Psychiatric Association in relation to the just-published Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) (1), from the time of the Advisory Group’s initial appointment in 2007."					
3993	"The appropriate architecture of a diagnostic classification of mental and behavioural disorders is an issue that has received substantial attention over the course of the revision (e.g. 2-4). One of the guiding principles of the ICD–11 is that it should reflect current scientific evidence regarding the relationships among disorders (5) rather than antiquated concepts such as ‘neurosis’, which have poor construct and predictive validity. In addition, a major goal of the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse for the current revision is to improve the clinical utility of this part of the ICD–11 (6, 7). Because the ICD–11 uses a different coding structure that is not based on a decimal numbering system, such that a larger number of blocks or groupings can be accommodated within the chapter, an important opportunity was presented to bring the classification more in line with current research and clinical practice in terms of how groupings of disorders are represented."					
3994	Three streams of work provide the rationale and evidence for the linear structure of Mental and Behavioural Disorders in the ICD–11.					
3995	"Evidence Reviews by Working Groups for ICD–11 Mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders"					
3996	"The first stream of work relates to the outcome of evidence reviews by the 14 Working Groups reporting to the Advisory Group, each of which had multiple face-to-face meetings over at least a 2-year period. The Working Groups were asked to review the available scientific evidence and other information about the clinical application of classifications in various settings throughout the world, and to provide evidence and a rationale for its groupings as well as the content and arrangement of categories within them. This work resulted in manuscripts describing the rationale for most groupings of disorders that have been published in or submitted to peer- reviewed journals (e.g. 8-15). Space does not permit detailing the rationale and evidence base for each structural change here, but this information as it relates to any specific decision can be provided on request based on the material generated by the Working Groups."					
3997	Formative Field Studies on Clinical Utility of the Linear Structure					
3998	"The second stream of work relevant to the linear structure of Mental and Behavioural Disorders focused on clinical utility and is represented by two formative field studies undertaken by the WHO and the Field Studies Coordination Group reporting to the Advisory Group (16, 17). The purpose of these studies was to examine the conceptualizations held by mental health professionals around the world of the relationships among mental disorders to inform decisions about the structure of the classification. From a clinical utility perspective, particularly in terms of improving the interface between health information and clinical practice, the most important and desirable features of a classification’s organisation is that (a) it helps clinicians find the categories that most accurately describe the patients they encounter as quickly, easily, and intuitively as possible and (b) the diagnostic categories so obtained would provide them with clinically useful information about treatment and management. A mental disorders classification that is difficult and cumbersome to implement in clinical practice and does not provide information that is of immediate value to the clinician has no hope of being implemented accurately at the encounter level in real-word health care settings. In that event, clinical practice will not be guided by the standardisation and operationalization of concepts and categories that are inherent in the classification, and important opportunities for practice improvement and outcomes assessment will be lost. In turn, a diagnostic system that is characterized by poor clinical utility at the encounter level cannot generate data based on those encounters that will be a valid basis for health programs and policies, or for global health statistics. The rationale behind these two studies was that if the ways in which clinicians conceptualized the organisation of mental disorders as encountered in their day-to-day clinical practice was found to be (a) consistent across countries, languages, and disciplines, and (b) distinct from the organisation of ICD–10, then this information could be used to create a classification of mental disorders that corresponds more closely to clinicians’ cognitive organisation of categories and would therefore be more intuitive and efficient for use in real- world health care settings."					
3999	"The first formative field study (17) was an internet-based study administered in both English and Spanish, in which 1,371 psychiatrists and psychologists from 64 countries participated. The second formative field study (16) involved the face-to-face administration of a standardised sorting and hierarchy-formation task to 517 mental health professionals in eight countries and five languages. Both studies found that clinicians’ conceptual map of mental disorders was rational and highly stable across profession, language, and country income level. Moreover, both studies found that the proposed structure for mental and behavioural disorders in ICD–11 was more consistent with clinicians’ conceptual models than the structure of either ICD–10 or DSM- IV. The second study also clearly demonstrated that clinicians preferred a ‘flatter’ structure with a larger number of groupings as compared with a more hierarchical structure with fewer groupings as found in ICD–10."					
4000	Harmonisation with DSM-5					
4001	"The third stream of work relates to efforts to harmonise the structure of the ICD–11 chapter on Mental and Behavioural Disorders with the structure of the DSM-5, where possible. Overall, the high degree of similarity between the overall structure of DSM-5 (1) and the proposed linear structure for ICD–11 Mental and Behavioural Disorders represents a major success of the ICD – DSM harmonisation effort. Relatively minor differences relate primarily to:"					
4002	"1. proposals to combine the classifications of ‘organic’ and ‘non-organic’ aspects of conditions such as sleep disorders and sexual dysfunctions in ICD–11 in separate chapters in ways that are more consistent with current evidence and clinical practice, which was not an option for DSM-5 given that it is by definition a classification of mental disorders; and"					
4003	"2. differences in conventions related to residual categories and mental disorders associated with other underlying disease under ICD–11 from decisions about the organisation of such categories in DSM-5. Additional information about the rationale for the few remaining substantive differences in overall structure between the two classifications is available upon request. It must be emphasized that the resulting similarity in organisation between the two systems is the product of several years of complex negotiations. Given that DSM-5 has already been published, further changes to the ICD–11 structure would almost certainly move ICD–11 in the direction of reduced similarity and harmonisation with DSM-5."

4022	3.2.7 Chapter 07 – Sleep–wake disorders					
4023	3.2.7.1 Chapter 07 – Structure of Chapter 07					
4024	"Chapter 07 is a new chapter in ICD–11. It contains Sleep-wake disorders that were previously located within the respiratory, neurology, or mental health chapters. By combining these disorders into one chapter, more detail can be included for many of the sleep related disorders. The hierarchy consists of:"					
4025	1st level - Broad category of disease/disorder type					
4026	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type					
4027	3rd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
4028	3.2.7.2 Chapter 07 – Rationale for Chapter 07					
4029	"As Sleep-wake disorders pertain to an area of overlap between mental health, neurological disorders and pulmonary conditions, the decision was made to place them together in one chapter."					
4030	3.2.8 Chapter 08 – Diseases of the nervous system					
4031	3.2.8.1 Chapter 08 – Structure of Chapter 08					
4032	"1st level - Mixture of diseases, disorders and sites and combinations of both."					
4033	2nd level - Subcategory mixture of specific disease or disorder type and sometimes site.					
4034	3.2.8.2 Chapter 08 – Rationale for Chapter 08					
4035	"ICD–11 sees a major overhaul in the organisation of the blocks which make up the neurology chapter. The restrictive decimal coding system of the ICD–10, with its capacity to contain only 11 blocks of disorders per chapter, resulted in blocks containing miscellaneous neurological entities which did not logically fit together, such as the episodic and paroxysmal disorders block, containing headache disorders, epilepsy, transient ischaemic attacks and sleep disorders. The ICD–11 now positions headache disorders, epilepsy and cerebrovascular disorders at a block level, and sleep disorders at chapter level (Chapter 07)."					
4036	"Not only has the structure of the neurological chapter changed, but the approach to classification also integrates current clinical practice and advancements in the understanding of neurological diseases. In the time since the ICD–10 was published, enormous progress in the fields of genetics, molecular biology and medical technologies have been made. An increase in the number of codes is inevitable when one reflects on the recent knowledge gain in neurology, so a balance between comprehensiveness, clinical utility and maintaining a public health approach is the aim. The working groups tackled this issue by considering the more common disorders to appear in the chapter, with less common aetiological variations of these disorders being subject to a ‘double coding’ technique. One major change which illustrates the advancement of knowledge is the addition of a block entitled ‘Paraneoplastic and autoimmune disorders of the nervous system’. This block contains immune-mediated neurological diseases, a field in which knowledge has exploded in recent years. A second example of how the new version reflects molecular biological advancement is through awarding Prion diseases block status despite their rarity. Previously, they featured as part of the infections of the central nervous system block, but research interest after the major public health issue in Europe in the 1990s has led to new variants of prion diseases being discovered."					
4037	The world has seen a large rise in the elderly population since the 1990s. Neurocognitive disorders have been declared as a major public health concern and research into its aetiology and neuropharmacology has boomed. The ICD–11 block on Neurocognitive disorders reflects the better understanding in this area.					
4038	"One final particularly noteworthy change can be found in the ‘Other disorders of the nervous system’ block. This block is employed to capture the ‘spill over’ from other neurology blocks and those disorders which are deemed unclassifiable elsewhere. In the ICD–10, due to the aforementioned decimal coding system, this block was an incongruent collection of diseases. This block has now reduced significantly in size due to the new, streamlined neurology chapter structure which includes new blocks of disorders previously contained in the ‘other disorders of the nervous system’ section of ICD–10. These include ‘disorders of consciousness’, ‘disorders of cerebrospinal fluid pressure and flow’, ‘disorders of the autonomic nervous system’, ‘nutritional and toxic disorders of the nervous system’ and ‘spinal cord disorders excluding trauma’. Their promotion to block status will hopefully have a positive effect on coding practices."					
4039	"One complicating issue facing the Neurology Topic Advisory has been the need to cross-link disorders which have a neurological presentation or phenotype to their aetiological roots within other chapters or blocks within the neurology chapter. One of the countless examples of this kind of relationship would be mitochondrial disorders of neuromuscular junction. They must be cross-linked both in the neurology chapter, and in the Endocrine, nutritional or metabolic diseases chapter."					
4040	3.2.9 Chapter 09 – Diseases of the visual system					
4041	3.2.9.1 Chapter 09 – Structure of Chapter 09					
4042	The general hierarchy of Chapter 09 consists of the following:					
4043	1st level - Broad category of anatomy					
4044	2nd level - Specific anatomy category					
4045	3rd level - Broad category of disease/disorder type					
4046	4th level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
4047	3.2.10 Chapter 10 - Diseases of the ear or mastoid process					
4048	3.2.10.1 Chapter 10 – Structure of Chapter 10					
4049	The general hierarchy of Chapter 10 consists of the following:

4054	3.2.11.1 Chapter 11 – Structure of Chapter 11					
4055	There are two main hierarchies in Chapter 11.					
4056	1st level - Broad category of disease/disorder type					
4057	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type					
4058	3rd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type

4063	3.2.11.2 Chapter 11 – Rationale for Chapter 11					
4064	"There have been large scale changes in clinical practice in cardiovascular diseases and their management since ICD-10 was published over 20 years ago. Changes introduced for ICD-11 in this chapter reflect these changes and the shift in disease profiles and increased survival following procedures. As a consequence, there has been a major expansion in the number of disease entities within ICD-11, with new classification hierarchies and updated nomenclature. For instance, the incidence of heart valve disease is no longer dominated by rheumatic fever in developed societies, although it remains important in developing nations, and consequently there has been a shift in diagnostic paradigms to that of valve type, then valve pathology followed by aetiology."					
4065	"Many items previously classified in ICD-10 as ‘Other forms of heart disease’ (I30-I52) have become major clinical issues in today’s cardiology, warranting the creation of new distinct higher-level categories. Two examples are:"					
4066	"Diseases of the myocardium, including extensive subsections on Myocarditis and Cardiomyopathy."					
4067	"Cardiac arrhythmia, including a large new subsection on ‘Cardiac arrhythmia associated with genetic disorder’ and ‘Pacemaker or implantable cardioverter or defibrillator or lead dysfunction’, both of which are increasingly important areas of clinical practice. The changes in this section have had major input and endorsement from the Paediatric & Congenital Electrophysiology Society and the International Society for Nomenclature of Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease."					
4068	"The change in the ICD revision process to be clinically driven has meant that areas primarily managed by non-cardiologists have been relocated to more suitable chapters. Thus, Cerebrovascular diseases have been reclassified to Chapter 08, `Diseases of the nervous system’ and oesophageal varices have been relocated to Diseases of the digestive system (Chapter 13)."					
4069	"A new subsection on Pulmonary Hypertension in the Pulmonary heart disease and diseases of pulmonary circulation section, is based on the resulting paper Updated Clinical Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension, following the 5th World Symposium held in Nice, France, in 2013."					
4070	The postprocedural disorders section has been markedly enlarged reflecting increased survival after cardiovascular procedures over the last two decades with recognition of an increasing number of patients with postprocedural morbidities and disease specific complications.					
4071	"The section on Congenital anomaly of heart and great vessels and related acquired abnormalities classified to Chapter 20 ‘Developmental anomalies’ has been based on the International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code (IPCCC), which has been created over the last decade by the International Society for Nomenclature of Paediatric and Congenital Heart Disease (ISNPCHD, http://www.ipccc.net). As a consequence, the 73 congenital cardiology ICD-10 entities in Q20-Q29 have been expanded to 316 diagnoses, as an accurate summation of the heterogeneity of cardiac malformations seen in clinical practice. Reference was also made to the Anatomic and clinical classification of congenital heart defects (ACC-CHD) with the corresponding IPCCC and ICD-10 codes."					
4072	3.2.12 Chapter 12 – Diseases of the respiratory system					
4073	3.2.12.1 Chapter 12 – Structure of Chapter 12					
4074	There are two main hierarchies in Chapter 12:					
4075	1st level - Broad category of disease/disorder type					
4076	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type with some anatomy included					
4077	3rd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
4078	OR					
4079	1st level - Broad category of anatomy					
4080	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type					
4081	3rd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
4082	3.2.12.2 Chapter 12 – Rationale for Chapter 12					
4083	"The changes to Chapter 12 have been made principally to provide current clinical terminology and classification of conditions primarily affecting the respiratory system and have been based on input from international societies and stakeholders. Infectious lung diseases have been moved to Chapter 01 to better reflect the infectious nature of these conditions. Neoplasms of the respiratory system are in Chapter 02 ‘Neoplasms’, and Developmental respiratory diseases are now located in Chapter 20 ‘Developmental anomalies’."					
4084	The grouping ‘Upper respiratory tract disorders’ contains upper respiratory tract diseases except for conditions that moved to the Infectious disease chapter.					
4085	"The Lower respiratory tract diseases shifted from the Chronic lower respiratory diseases of the ICD-10, but Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was made an independent category based on an international concept."					
4086	"Cystic fibrosis has been moved to Certain lower respiratory tract diseases and multi- parented to metabolic disorders in the Endocrine chapter because: ‘The representative clinical conditions of cystic fibrosis are intractable respiratory infection, end stage respiratory failure, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and digestive organ lesions such as the meconium ileus. Cystic fibrosis is a disease due to an abnormality of the Cl ion channel which is CFTR, symptoms of the respiratory symptom is recognised in nearly all cases of patients. The cause of death is mainly respiratory abnormality, and this disease is the target disease of lung transplantation.’ This description of cystic fibrosis is found in representative textbooks (‘Diseases of the Airways’ in the textbook ‘Fraser and Pare’s Disease of the Chest’)."					
4087	‘OBSTRUCTIVE DISEASES’ in the textbook ‘Murray and Nadel’s Textbook of Respiratory Medicine’					
4088	‘OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASES’ in the textbook ‘Fishman’s pulmonary diseases and disorders’					
4089	"‘Disease of the Airways’ in the textbook ‘Fraser and Pare’s Disease of the Chest’ ‘Pulmonary Diseases’ in the textbook ‘Washington Manual of Medical Therapeutics, The, 34ed.’"					
4090	"The section pertaining to Inhalation, occupational and environmental lung disease has been based on input from the WHO Occupational Health Division."					
4091	The Certain specified respiratory diseases principally affecting the lung interstitium shifted from the Other respiratory diseases principally affecting the interstitium. The Idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis was made an independent category based on an international concept and the category of the Primary interstitial lung diseases specific to infancy and childhood was created independently based on the proposal of the Paediatric Topic Advisory Group (TAG).					
4092	"The section of the Certain diseases of the respiratory system and the section of the Postprocedural respiratory disorders were shifted from Other diseases of the respiratory system of ICD-10 except for the Mediastinal and diaphragm disorders that moved to the section of Pleural, diaphragm and mediastinal disorders."					
4093	3.2.13 Chapter 13 – Diseases of the digestive system					
4094	3.2.13.1 Chapter 13 – Structure of Chapter 13					
4095	The general hierarchy of Chapter 13 consists of the following:					
4096	1st level - Detailed anatomy					
4097	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type					
4098	3rd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
4099	3.2.13.2 Chapter 13 – Rationale for Chapter 13					
4100	"ICD-11 has been improved in structure and content to include diseases and disorders of the orofacial complex. There are several other tissues which as essential components of the orofacial complex, have an important function, and their impairment will have a direct impact on oral health status. It is important to recognise that oral health is more than having healthy teeth; having oral health is being free of chronic oral-facial pain conditions, oral and pharyngeal cancers, oral soft tissue lesions, periodontal (gum) disease, tooth decay and tooth loss and tooth surface loss, birth defects such as cleft lip and palate, and scores of other diseases and disorders that affect the oral, dental, and craniofacial tissues (orofacial complex) as well as associations with systemic health and disease. This underlines the importance of providing a coherent system for coding and classifying data on orofacial complex diseases and disorders so that the oral health professional can record and collect data from each patient at their clinics, regardless of whether such facility may be part of large hospitals, or small clinics. It is anticipated that being able to record and interpret such data will enable health professionals to contribute to the improvement of oral health as an essential component of general health and will stimulate the use of ICD-11 by oral health personnel."					
4101	"Major changes have been made to this chapter with very detailed anatomical groups being added to the hierarchy for the digestive tract, according to rostral-caudal order, with the exception of categories for hernia, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and inflammatory bowel diseases."					
4102	"Functional gastrointestinal disorders are independently described because their pathophysiology is considered from the standpoint of ‘Brain-Gut axis’, and not only from their impact on the gastrointestinal tract. Inflammatory bowel diseases are also independently described mainly because Crohn’s disease involves several organs. In each anatomical group (organ group), aetiology based classifications are used to sub-classify disorders. Particularly, GI disorders are arranged in the following categories:"					
4103	A. Acquired anatomical or morphological alterations					
4104	B. Motor disorders					
4105	C. Inflammation including ulcer					
4106	D. Vascular disorders					
4107	E. Non-neoplastic polyps					
4108	"In addition, there are two other categories listed, although Chapter 13 is not the primary place for these disorders."					
4109	F. Structural developmental anomalies (located in Chapter 20 Developmental anomalies)					
4110	G. Neoplasms (located in Chapter 02 Neoplasms)					
4111	"Important or common digestive diseases have been allocated their own category, for example gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, columnar metaplastic epithelium, intestinal malabsorption and protein-losing enteropathy, ulcerative colitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and diverticular disease. Polyps are now classified independently, and not in the ‘other diseases’ section of anatomical site."					
4112	"Common digestive diseases extending over several organs are classified principally into the disease category of the rostral organ. For example, ‘Gastroenteritis’ is classified in ‘Gastritis’, and ‘Gastroduodenal ulcer’ is classified in ‘Gastric ulcer’. The item ‘Peptic ulcer, site unspecified’ should not be used due to advances in medical technology. It should be classified into either the ‘Oesophageal ulcer, Gastric ulcer, Duodenal ulcer or Anastomotic ulcer’ category, depending on the disease site."					
4113	"Vascular disorders of GI organs have been allocated their own category. Oesophageal varices, gastric varices and haemorrhoids are now classified in Chapter 13. In ‘Diseases of liver’, there are new independent categories including Metabolic and transporter liver disease, Autoimmune liver diseases, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and Vascular disorders of the liver."					
4114	"For the classification of Chronic liver disease with cirrhosis, ‘Liver cirrhosis’, an item in ‘Hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis’, is used. For example, ‘Chronic hepatitis B’ and ‘Liver cirrhosis’, ‘Chronic hepatitis C’ and ‘Liver cirrhosis’, ‘Autoimmune hepatitis’ and ‘Liver cirrhosis’, ‘Primary biliary cholangiopathy’ and ‘Liver cirrhosis’, etc. There are new independent sections for ‘Diseases of gallbladder and biliary duct’ and ‘Diseases of pancreas’. Within these new sections, there are new independent categories including Structural developmental anomalies, Congenital anomalies, Acquired anatomical alterations, Cholangitis, Cystic diseases of the pancreas, Chronic pancreatitis and Autoimmune pancreatitis."					
4115	3.2.14 Chapter 14 – Diseases of the skin					
4116	3.2.14.1 Chapter 14 – Structure of Chapter 14					
4117	The general hierarchy of Chapter 14 consists of the following:					
4118	1st level - Broad category of disease/disorder type					
4119	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type with some anatomical site					
4120	3rd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
4121	3.2.14.2 Chapter 14 – Rationale for Chapter 14					
4122	"Major changes have been made to this chapter adding detail coming from the fusion of the American, British, and German dermatological terminologies."					
4123	3.2.15 Chapter 15 – Diseases of the musculoskeletal system or connective tissue					
4124	3.2.15.1 Chapter 15 – Structure of Chapter 15					
4125	The general hierarchy of Chapter 15 consists of the following:					
4126	1st level - Broad category of disease/disorder type					
4127	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type with some anatomical site					
4128	3rd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
4129	3.2.15.2 Chapter 15 – Rationale for Chapter 15					
4130	The American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) Diagnostic Criteria for Rheumatoid Arthritis (under development) was used to inform the code hierarchy and content model attributes for Rheumatoid arthritis. Current literature informed the change of title of ‘systemic connective tissue disorders’ to ‘non-organ specific systemic autoimmune disorders’. The changes to vasculitis were based on the classification of the Chapel Hill International Consensus Conference on the Nomenclature of Systemic Vasculitis.					
4131	The category ‘Dermatopolymyositis’ was changed to ‘Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies’ with a change of axes and introduction of further granularity.					
4132	"The revisions to the classification of spondyloarthritis reflect current expert opinion with comments from Dr Robert Landewé, with a separation of axial and peripheral. Together, the axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis criteria cover the entire spectrum of what was formerly called (undifferentiated) spondyloarthritis and (ankylosing) spondylitis. There is re-arrangement of infective spondyloarthritis, with a secondary axis for the major types of infective process, i.e.  bacterial, fungal etc., and supplementary codes to be used for the specific infection."					
4133	The new category for Auto-inflammatory syndromes is based on the work of the International Society of Systemic Auto-inflammatory Disease (ISSAID).					
4134	3.2.16 Chapter 16 – Diseases of the genitourinary system					
4135	3.2.16.1 Chapter 16 – Structure of Chapter 16					
4136	"Chapter 16 has specific sections for Diseases of the female genitourinary system, Diseases of the male genitourinary system, Disorders of breast, Diseases of the urinary system and Postprocedural disorders of the genitourinary system."					
4137	The general hierarchy of Chapter 16 consists of the following:					
4138	1st level - Broad category of body system					
4139	2nd level - Broad disease/disorder type (with some anatomy)					
4140	3rd level - Specific disease/disorder type (with some anatomy)					
4141	3.2.16.2 Chapter 16 – Rationale for chapter 16					
4142	"The changes to Chapter 16 are aimed at increasing the clinical utility of the classification by providing a more user-friendly hierarchical structure, increased international comparability and standardisation of genitourinary conditions. This is accomplished by including the most scientifically accurate and internationally agreed-upon terms and definitions provided by various international stakeholders, including the WHO department of Reproductive Health and Research, the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), National Kidney Foundation and the Kidney Disease International Global Outcomes (KDIGO)."					
4143	"The chapter hierarchy is subdivided into Diseases of the Female Genital System, Diseases of the Male Genital System and Diseases of the Urinary system. This architecture of the female genital system and the male genital system was designed to improve the end-user experience. The female genital system hierarchy is broken down into non-inflammatory and inflammatory disorders, and then further divided by anatomical grouping in the order of gynaecologic (and obstetric) examination (from external to internal genitalia), where applicable. (Vulva, Vagina, Cervix, Uterus, Fallopian Tube, Ovary, Pelvic Cavity)."					
4144	"These groupings have further subdivisions for congenital and acquired abnormalities, as appropriate."					
4145	"To reflect the current scientific understanding for certain genitourinary conditions, additional detail has been included for the following areas:"					
4146	Amenorrhea					
4147	Ovarian dysfunction					
4148	Female pelvic pain					
4149	Endometriosis					
4150	Adenomyosis					
4151	Female infertility					
4152	Male infertility					
4153	Early pregnancy loss					
4154	Pregnancy outcomes					
4155	The Kidney failure section of the classification has been revised to reflect the current evidence-based definitions of acute kidney versus chronic kidney disease and the new Kidney Disease (‘Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definitions and staging system for acute kidney failure’.)					
4156	3.2.17 Chapter 17 – Conditions related to sexual health					
4157	3.2.17.1 Chapter 17 – Structure of Chapter 17					
4158	New chapter in ICD-11 divided into major sections for:					
4159	Sexual dysfunctions					
4160	Sexual pain disorders					
4161	Gender incongruence					
4162	1st level - Broad category of condition					
4163	2nd level - Specific type of condition					
4164	3rd level - Specific disease/disorder					
4165	3.2.17.2 Chapter 17 – Rationale for Chapter 17					
4166	"The chapter has been formulated to group sexually related conditions. This also allows categorisation of gender identity related conditions without stigmatisation, while maintaining recognition of these entities as real conditions so that related health interventions can be accommodated within the health system."					
4167	"3.2.18 Chapter 18 – Pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium"					
4168	3.2.18.1 Chapter 18 – Structure of Chapter 18					
4169	The general hierarchy of Chapter 18 consists of the following:					
4170	"1st level - Broad category related to the stages of pregnancy, childbirth or the puerperium"					
4171	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type					
4172	3rd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
4173	3.2.18.2 Chapter 18 – Rationale for Chapter 18					
4174	"The changes to this chapter are intended to increase the clinical utility of the classification by providing a more user-friendly hierarchical structure. Increasing the international comparability and standardisation of conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium by including the most scientifically accurate and internationally agreed-upon terms and definitions provided by various international stakeholders, such as the WHO department of RHR, International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), was also a highly important aspect of the modifications. Particular attention was given to correct integration of concepts and definitions of the International Committee Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ICMART)."					
4175	"The changes reflect the current understanding for certain conditions related to pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium. Additional specifications have been included for Early pregnancy loss"					
4176	3.2.19 Chapter 19 – Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period					
4177	3.2.19.1 Chapter 19 – Structure of Chapter 19					
4178	The general hierarchy of Chapter 19 consists of the following:					
4179	1st level - Broad category disease/disorder type and some anatomy					
4180	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type					
4181	3rd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
4182	3.2.20 Chapter 20 – Developmental anomalies					
4183	3.2.20.1 Chapter 20 – Structure of Chapter 20					
4184	Chapter 20 has undergone a major restructure with it now having four major sections					
4185	Structural developmental anomalies primarily affecting one body system					
4186	1st level - Broad category of anatomy					
4187	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type					
4188	3rd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
4189	Multiple developmental anomalies or syndromes					
4190	1st level - Broad category of anatomy					
4191	2nd level - Specific disease/disorder type					
4192	3rd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
4193	"Chromosomal anomalies, excluding gene mutations"					
4194	1st level - Specific disease/disorder type					
4195	2nd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
4196	Conditions with disorders of intellectual development as a relevant clinical feature					
4197	1st level - Non-syndromic vs syndromic conditions					
4198	2nd level - Further specificity of disease/disorder type					
4199	3.2.20.2 Chapter 20 – Rationale for Chapter 20					
4200	"The ICD–10 classification of developmental anomalies is covered by Chapter XVII: Q00-Q99 Congenital malformations, deformations and chromosomal abnormalities."					
4201	"It is a very heterogeneous chapter, including malformations, genetic syndromes (with or without malformations) and chromosomal anomalies. This leads to confusion between the genetic origin of a disease and malformation. Therefore, all genetic syndromes without structural developmental anomalies are excluded from this chapter and are reallocated to appropriate chapters of the ICD-11, according to the affected body system(s)."					
4202	The new chapter 20 has three main divisions:					
4203	Structural developmental anomalies/malformations					
4204	Multiple developmental anomalies and syndromes					
4205	Chromosomal anomalies and genetic defects					
4206	"The first division ‘Structural developmental anomalies/malformations’ includes isolated conditions affecting only one body system. It is organised in sections corresponding to those body systems, which are also classified in the other relevant chapters of ICD–11."					
4207	"The second division ‘Multiple developmental anomalies and syndromes’ includes conditions affecting several locations within one body system, or several body systems simultaneously. Syndromes which can be said to affect one body system predominantly are assigned to corresponding sections within this division. Syndromes which affect several body systems, without one clearly predominating, are put together in a specific section at the end of the division. There is also a section for Dysplasia syndromes due to inborn errors of metabolism, all of them primarily classified in the chapter for metabolic diseases."					
4208	"The third division ‘Chromosomal anomalies and genetic defects’ departs from the clinical approach generally followed in the ICD and classifies developmental anomalies defined genetically or cytogenetically, since there is no clear-cut distinction between genetics and cytogenetics. We have started to include specific deletions and duplications corresponding to a clear phenotype, knowing that many more will be described in the coming years. Future ones will be added whenever necessary, during the post-publication revisions of the ICD–11."					
4209	"A special problem is how to deal with diseases historically defined clinically but including a chromosomal/genetic anomaly as aetiology. In some cases, there are several aetiologies for the clinical entity, and not all of them are chromosomal anomalies: for instance, Silver-Russell syndrome can be caused by a 11p15 duplication, a 7p11.2p13 duplication, but also by maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 or 11 and imprinting defects of 11p15. In other cases, there is an overwhelming correspondence between the clinical entity and a cytogenetic aetiology: for instance, Williams-Beuren syndrome corresponds to the 7q11.23 deletion."					
4210	"Polyhierarchy is used in a restricted way within the frame of this chapter: once a disease is assigned to a section, it is generally not secondarily classified elsewhere in the chapter. The structure would otherwise become too intricate. On the other hand, all entities in this chapter are to be classified in other chapters of ICD–11, when appropriate."					
4211	"3.2.21 Chapter 21 – Symptoms, signs or clinical findings, not elsewhere classified"					
4212	3.2.21.1 Chapter 21 – Structure of Chapter 21					
4213	"Chapter 21 is divided into major sections based on body systems. Each of these sections has the following categories, as appropriate:"					
4214	Symptoms and signs					
4215	Clinical findings					
4216	An additional section is located at the end of this chapter for Ill-defined and unknown causes of mortality.					
4217	3.2.21.2 Chapter 21 – Rationale for Chapter 21					
4218	"The different chapters of ICD–10 included several clinical manifestation categories, some of them as asterisk codes. In order to simplify the structure, improve the use of postcoordination, and also to remove ‘ill-defined’ conditions from organ chapters, several former asterisk codes, additional detail for diverse conditions, and the said ill-defined conditions have been moved here. All follow the main organisation by anatomy, and the anatomical groupings have a secondary parent to the relevant organ chapter, improving the user guidance."					
4219	"3.2.22 Chapter 22 – Injury, poisoning or certain other consequences of external causes"					
4220	3.2.22.1 Chapter 22 – Structure of Chapter 22					
4221	The general hierarchy of Chapter 22 consists of the following:					
4222	1st level - Broad category of anatomy (e.g. head; hip & thigh)					
4223	2nd level - Broad category of injury type (e.g. fracture; open wound					
4224	3rd level - Further specification					
4225	OR					
4226	1st level - Broad category of cause of injury					
4227	2nd level - Specific injury type					
4228	3rd level - Further specificity of injury type					
4229	3.2.22.2 Chapter 22 – Rationale for Chapter 22					
4230	The principles of the revision were:					
4231	"Maintain good back-compatibility with ICD–10, particularly by minimising change at the former three-character level. Change at the former four-character level is more extensive but has also been done with this principle in mind."					
4232	Take account of the extensions to this chapter in clinical modifications of ICD–10 because:					
4233	They are evidence of extensions required to serve clinical purposes in identified situations.					
4234	It is preferable to minimise incompatibilities with these classifications.					
4235	Take account of classifications other than ICD that are in wide clinical use for conditions in scope for this chapter.					
4236	"Take account of advice, solicited and proffered."					
4237	"Increased attention to distinctions pertinent to treatment choices and to outcomes, including disability."					
4238	"These include allowing identification of clinically and prognostically important aspects of fractures (notably whether they extend into a joint) and organ/vessel injuries (degree). Some conditions are much more important when bilateral, and in such instances side has been proposed as precoordinated entities (e.g. injury of the eyes). The United States’ clinical modification of ICD-10 (ICD-10-CM) was particularly valuable in this regard, as its injury chapter makes many distinctions, beyond ICD–10, which follow or are consistent with credible and widely used clinical classifications relevant to injury treatment and outcome."					
4239	"Increased attention has been given to injury conditions specific to childhood (e.g. greenstick and epiphyseal fractures) and to injury conditions that are indicative of possible intentional injury (e.g. posterior rib fractures, ‘bucket-handle’ and ‘corner’ fractures)."					
4240	The work was done with the awareness that this chapter is not primarily used to code the Underlying Cause of Death.					
4241	The morbidity use case is particularly important for this chapter.					
4242	3.2.23 Chapter 23 – External causes of morbidity or mortality					
4243	3.2.23.1 Chapter 23 – Structure of Chapter 23					
4244	The general hierarchy of Chapter 23 consists of the following sections:					
4245	"1st level - Intent of external cause (unintentional, intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined intent and intent pending.)"					
4246	2nd level - Broad category of the mechanism of the external cause					
4247	3rd level - More specific mechanism and objects/substances involved in causing injury					
4248	4th level - Further characterisation of the external cause					
4249	"Other sections include Exposure to extreme forces, Maltreatment, Legal intervention, Armed conflict and Causes of health care related harm."					
4250	3.2.23.2 Chapter 23 – Rationale for Chapter 23					
4251	"The main aim of the changes was to provide a more uniform coding structure while still maintaining high compatibility with ICD–10. The changes to the traffic injury categories are aimed at simplifying code selection, while the section on Operations of war and armed conflicts has been revised to capture the more current situations of armed conflicts. Another enhancement has been to produce a single, hierarchical list of noxious substances to serve the Injury and External Causes chapters."					
4252	All mechanisms/objects codable for all intents:					
4253	More uniform code structure					
4254	Revised ‘Intent’ dimension (N.B. Intent pending; ISH: suicidal/non-suicidal)					
4255	"Retain transport codes, but expand vehicle types"					
4256	Expanded Place of Occurrence codes					
4257	Expanded and revised Activity dimension (N.B. work-relatedness)					
4258	Revision of Complications of Medical & Surgical Care					
4259	Expanded Legal/War Codes					
4260	Improved provision for maltreatment syndromes					
4261	Introduction of additional dimensions (optional)					
4262	"Revision of External Cause index, rules and guidelines"					
4263	"Provide for Mortality, Morbidity, Lower Resource Settings, Research"					
4264	"Progress has been made on all of these points, though constrained in some respects, particularly for the mortality use-case (due to the tight constraints on code-space combined with the lack of provision for postcoordination/cluster-coding). A section on limitations is at the end of these notes."					
4265	Notes provided here focus on several of these points; additional material will be provided on other aspects on request. Comments are also provided here on the two main issues that involve both the External Causes chapter and the Injury chapter (both also involve Chapter X ‘Extension codes’): substances; complications of care (Safety & Quality).					
4266	Transport					
4267	"Four dimensions are implicit in the ICD–10 range V01-V89: injured person’s mode of transport (e.g. motorcycle), whether the injurious event occurred in road traffic (if so, the resulting injury is a road injury), the injured person’s role (e.g. passenger), and what other type of vehicle was involved, if any (counterpart). All four dimensions are required for a revised structure that is conceptually equivalent to the ICD–10 ‘transport accidents’ module at four- character level."					
4268	"All four dimensions have been precoordinated in the Unintentional transport injury module. This produces a structure with high back-compatibility with ICD–10 at four-character level. It preserves all top-level modes of transport categories (some now split) and the four conceptual dimensions (mode; and for land transport modes: whether in traffic, transport user role and counterpart)."					
4269	"In recognition of code-space limitations, and of the fact that most transport injury cases are unintentional, precoordination of transport cases in the other main intent blocks (intentional self-harm, assault, undetermined intent, and intent pending) is limited to intent by mode of transportation. However, the other dimensions are available for optional use."					
4270	The revised transport block includes changes made to resolve problems identified with the ICD– 10 transport section.					
4271	Split several modes of transport to enable identification of important and emerging types that cannot be identified in ICD–10.					
4272	"Refined and revised terms and definitions (for clarity, to fill gaps in the set provided in ICD–10 and to improve comparability with terms used internationally for road safety)."					
4273	"Various other revisions (e.g. of types of vessel in water transport section). Note that the coordination order has been altered from the equivalent in ICD–10, from: mode, counterpart, then user role and traffic status combined to: mode, traffic status, user role, counterpart."					
4274	"The main reason for this change was to simplify the selection of ‘traffic accident’ categories, which are frequently required when reporting road injury."					
4275	War and armed conflict					
4276	"A revised classification is provided for inclusion as the expansion of intent category Armed conflict (Operations of war in ICD–10). The classification largely follows the expansion of Y36 in the United States’ clinical modification of ICD–10 (ICD–10-CM). This follows the four-character categories in ICD–10 and provides subdivisions, which follow inclusion notes given in ICD–10. In addition, sub-categories are provided to distinguish whether the injured person was military or civilian."					
4277	"The rubric has been altered by the addition of ‘…and armed conflict’ to ‘Operations of war’, and the inclusion term has been altered accordingly. ‘War’ and ‘civil insurrection’ (which also formed part of the inclusion term) were not defined in ICD–10. The use of a term broader than ‘war’ is considered desirable because war, in the sense of formally declared armed conflicts between nation states (or subnational entities) has become uncommon. Armed conflicts of a range of types and intensities, while tending to become less common, remain much more numerous than wars. Restriction of use of this category to declared wars, and/or to armed conflicts that meet a commonly used criterion of intensity (1,000 or more battle-related deaths in a calendar year = war) was thought to be unduly restrictive. The alternative proposed here is to also include injuries due to ‘Minor’ armed conflicts, defined as those resulting in 25 to < 1,000 battle-related deaths in a calendar year. Application of the definition is aided by the existence of a publicly accessible database listing conflicts found to satisfy it."					
4278	Crossover issues					
4279	"These are matters that affect both the injury and the external causes chapters, and other parts of the ICD."					
4280	Toxic effects of substances					
4281	"Toxic effects of noxious substances appear in ICD–10 at several points, in the Injury and External Causes chapters, and in other chapters. Code lists at those points differ in specificity and are not completely consistent. A design aim for ICD–11 is to produce a single, hierarchical list of noxious substances to serve all of the purposes required for the Injury and External Causes chapters. The benefits of this are: external source(s) can define-by-example the inclusions of the ICD–11 list; and if the external source(s) are actively updated, then this provides a way for the ICD–11 coverage of substances to remain current."					
4282	"The term ‘Harmful effects’ is used for all types of harm resulting from harmful chemical effects of substances of all types. It is recognised that other terms, such as ‘toxic effect’, ‘poisoning’, ‘chemical corrosion’ and ‘envenomation’ are sometimes used in the context of particular substances. These terms will be included as synonyms and subordinate terms where in common use. A number of sources were consulted, including ICECI Objects & Substances dimension; Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification; TAG-IEG advisory groups on drugs and poisons; Quality and safety TAG; SNOMED; IPCS INTOX."					
4283	The list has two main hierarchical levels.					
4284	"The first, with 16 categories, is conceptually related to the code-list that is present in ICD–10 at X40-X49 (Accidental poisoning by and exposure to noxious substances) and the equivalent points in the Intentional Self-harm and Undetermined intent code-blocks. The list results from application of these principles:"					
4285	"It should have only a few categories. This is necessary for practicability, especially in the context of cause of death coding and because the block structure of the external causes chapter has the effect that each additional category adds several rows."					
4286	The categories should refer to substances or classes of substances that are important causes of mortality or morbidity.					
4287	"As many as possible of the categories should be sufficiently specific so meaningful as reporting groups. (By comparison, several categories in the ICD–10 blocks such as X40-X49 are so broad as to be difficult to interpret)."					
4288	The several main contexts of exposure were kept in mind when specifying categories (i.e.  recreational/street use; clinical use; self-harm; industrial and other exposures).					
4289	"The 16 categories, either alone or combined with others, allow backwards comparability with eight of the ten categories in ICD–10 X40-X49 (and the equivalent groups in the ISH and Undetermined intent blocks). The only exceptions are two residual groups: ‘…other gases and vapours’ and ‘…other and unspecified chemicals and noxious substances’. The second level provides categories (n=381), with about the same number and specificity of substances that are provided for in the injury and external causes chapters of ICD–10. It includes all of the categories of substances that are specified in the ‘Cause of harm’ component of the Quality and Safety TAG classification."					
4290	"Some categories have been added: to allow for pharmacological innovation and changes in drug use (e.g. synthetic cannabinoids); to reflect additions to ICD–10 made in its clinical modifications (e.g. more specificity concerning anticoagulants); to allow more specific identification of prominent drugs (e.g. paracetamol); to provide for additional widely-used recreational drugs (e.g. Cathinone, the main active agent in khat); and on advice from other TAGs (e.g. types of substance added by the Safety and Quality TAG). We anticipate that more categories will be added in future updates, to reflect changes in drug availability and use."					
4291	"A more comprehensive list of substances (a superset of the hierarchical list), with synonyms for many of the entries, will be provided in Chapter X ‘Extension codes’. That list shares the same hierarchical structure as the precoordinated codes. It also takes account of the ICD–11 Supplementary Classification of Contact Allergens prepared by the Dermatology TAG. Entries in the Extension codes substances list will be specified in terms of equivalent terms in SNOMED-CT."					
4292	Complications of care (Quality and Safety)					
4293	This section briefly describes the model for coding complications of care that has been developed by the Quality and Safety Topic Advisory Group (TAG).					
4294	"The model has three parts, each of which must be coded. The postcoordinated codes for all the parts must be designated as belonging to a cluster. The three concepts are:"					
4295	1. The resultant injury or harm;					
4296	2. The cause of harm; and					
4297	3. The ‘Mode/Mechanism’ of harm. Classifications and code-sets have been developed for (2) and (3) by the Quality and safety TAG. The categories have been entered into the External Causes chapter. The resultant harm (1) is to be coded by using the most appropriate disease or injury code from any part of ICD–11.					
4298	"The construct would, in principle, fit well into ICD–11 as follows:"					
4299	1. Resultant injury or harm. Code selected from anywhere in ICD–11.					
4300	2. The cause or ‘Mode’ of harm: Code selected from the relevant block in External Causes chapter					
4301	3. ‘Mode/Mechanism’ of harm					
4302	"Sanctioning rules lead coders to the subset of ‘Mode’ codes that are relevant, given the selected ‘Cause’ (e.g. if ‘Cause’ is a drug, then the relevant ‘Modes’ are categories such as overdose and underdose)."					
4303	3.2.24 Chapter 24 – Factors influencing health status or contact with health services					
4304						
4305	3.2.24.1 Chapter 24 – Structure of Chapter 24					
4306	This chapter has two major sections: - Reasons for contact with the health service - Factors influencing health status					
4307	The general hierarchy of Chapter 24 consists of the following axis:					
4308	1st level - Broad category of a particular health status or service					
4309	2nd level - Specific condition					
4310	3.2.24.2 Chapter 24 – Rationale for Chapter 24					
4311	"Initially, the Functioning Topic Advisory Group for ICD–11 (fTAG) was tasked with the review of the Factors Chapter. They were to evaluate the necessity of each of the 801 codes and propose a revised hierarchical structure for the essential content that would remain. This content was to be both clinically relevant and use-friendly as well as allowing the necessary space for expansion using the extension codes, as necessary. fTAG organised a review that identified the major ‘types’ of codes as ‘diagnostic’, ‘interventional’, ‘contextual factors’ and ‘other/debatable’. This review was combined with the general structure of the ICPC2 classification section on ‘social problems’ and a new organisation was designed that combined the ICPC2 hierarchy with the ICD–11 codes. For the ICD-11 MMS, a shoreline exercise was then undertaken on the new structure to decrease granularity seen as unnecessary."					
4312	3.2.25 Chapter 25 – Codes for special purposes					
4313	3.2.25.1 Chapter 25 – Structure of Chapter 25					
4314	This chapter consists of two blocks:					
4315	"International provisional assignment of new diseases of uncertain aetiology, containing the international emergency codes"					
4316	"National provisional assignment of new diseases of uncertain aetiology, containing codes for use by individual countries"					
4317	3.2.26 Chapter 26 - Supplementary Chapter Traditional Medicine Conditions - Module 1					
4318	"‘Traditional Medicine Module 1’ (TM1) chapter is a new supplementary chapter for optional use in ICD, and as such is referred to as the ‘TM1 chapter’. The rationale for its inclusion in ICD-11 is to enable Traditional Medicine health services and encounters to count and be counted nationally and internationally. The Module in this chapter in its current form refers to disorders and patterns which originated in ancient Chinese Medicine and developed throughout history to incorporate contemporary science and technology. These disorders and patterns are commonly used in China, Japan, Korea, United States of America, Australia, Europe and elsewhere around the world. The classification rubrics represent a unified set of harmonised Traditional Medicine disorders and patterns from national classifications from China, Japan and Korea. Future Modules may be developed for other forms of Traditional Medicine practices."					
4319	Scope:					
4320	This chapter has currently been designed for morbidity recording and reporting. It must not be used for mortality coding and reporting.					
4321	Content and structure:					
4322	"The content and structure of the TM1 Chapter represent a common language developed jointly through the international cooperation of Traditional Medicine clinicians, researchers, academics and classification experts to enable international comparability of practice and reporting of morbidity in Traditional Medicine. Standardisation of this TM1 classification will allow clinical documentation in different countries to incorporate the same concepts and enable coders and users to extract comparable morbidity data from that documentation. Coders must also be guided by rules which reflect the clinical diagnostic decision-making process. However, the rules are relatively flexible to allow for national adaptations and research questions concerning relationships between diseases, disorders and patterns to be framed from a number of different angles."					
4323	"The English terms do not necessarily represent the most common translation of the TM terms in Chinese, Korean or Japanese. Where the best fit English TM translation resulted in the same term as used in Western Medicine, it was necessary to indicate a difference between the Western Medicine (WM) concept and TM concept where the same term had different definitions in TM and WM. This difference in definition is indicated by the use of (TM1) for disorders and patterns throughout the TM chapter."					
4324	Terminology:					
4325	"The Supplementary Chapter Traditional Medicine Conditions, Module 1, uses the terms disorder and pattern to describe concepts. This is different from the concept descriptions in the Western Medicine chapters which refer to diseases (clinical pictures) and syndromes (clinical presentations). The TM1 chapter is divided into separate sections for disorder and pattern to emphasise the independence of these concepts."					
4326	Definitions					
4327	"A disorder in traditional medicine (disorder (TM1)) refers to a set of dysfunctions in any body system which is judged from associated signs, symptoms or findings. Each disorder (TM1) may be defined by its symptomatology, aetiological explanation based on traditional medicine, course and outcome, treatment response or linkage to interacting environmental factors. A disorder (TM1) is a clinical picture that is relatively stable and reflects the local pathology and related specific manifestations commonly found in the anatomy and function of the affected individuals."					
4328	A pattern in traditional medicine (pattern (TM1)) refers to the manifestation of the patient’s health condition at a given moment in time including all findings which may include:					
4329	"Symptomatology: pattern of specific and non-specific signs, symptoms or unique findings by traditional medicine diagnostic methods, including the taking of the pulse, examination of the tongue, abdominal examination and other methods that reflect the systemic response of the patient in a dysfunctional condition."					
4330	"Constitution: the characteristics of an individual, including structural and functional characteristics, temperament, ability to adapt to environmental changes, or susceptibility to various health conditions."					
4331	"A pattern (TM1) is a clinical picture that is relatively temporary, reflects on the systemic response of the patient and combined pattern of specific and non-specific manifestations that usually hold a multifactorial relationship with the local pathology and the constitutional traits of the patient. A pattern may show individual difference even in the individuals affected by the same pathology that may be further analysed by the theoretical frame of Traditional Medicine."					
4332	"Traditional Medicine disorder and pattern are named after the body structures, causal explanations, properties and severity which present for clinical investigation and diagnosis. TM1 pattern may denote an individually different pattern (TM1) of systemic responses to the WM disease or TM1 disorder. Pattern is a concept unique to TM1 and may be different from TM1 disorder in the following ways:"					
4333	Table 1: Characteristics of Traditional Medicine Disorders and Patterns					
4334	Distinguishing Feature	Disorder in Traditional Medicine	Pattern in Traditional Medicine			
4335	Constant/ Temporary	A clinical picture that is relatively constant throughout the duration of that disorder	A clinical picture that is relatively temporary			
4336	Constant Pathology/ Temporary Response	Usually delivers information reflecting the constant pathology	Usually delivers information reflecting the temporary overall manifestation or response of the patient			
4337	Specific/ Non-specific	A concept that summarises findings that are specific to the pathologic process under investigation	The combination of the manifestations that encompasses both specific symptoms/signs and non-specific findings			
4338	Linear/ Multifactorial	May be applied for a time span. A disorder coding may be based on the main pathologic process which may show a causal relationship with the main manifestations in the patient	"A pattern may be applied for a specific time span, too. However, a pattern code is based on the summarised whole picture that may be observed in the patient based on the perspectives of traditional medicine theories. A pattern is recognized based on the analysis of the systemic findings in the patient’s body and mind which reflect the pathologic processes, responses to the pathologic processes, other concomitant findings, and innate or acquired constitutional traits of the patient"			
4339	Commonality/ Individuality	Used to describe the general characteristics considered to be relatively common to the population suffering from one particular disorder	Used to describe the individual characteristics considered to be relatively specific to the patient at that time			
4340	General/ Theoretical	Usually described with general terms of anatomy and physiology together with terms of signs and symptoms	"Usually described with terms of the traditional medicine theories that are used to summarise the underlying mechanism in the patient such as yin and yang balance, cold and heat, meridian, or constitution"			
4341	3.2.27 Section V – Supplementary section for functioning assessment					
4342	This section is new. The list of 47 entities in this section is intended for assessment and scoring in the context of ICD. It is using ICF functioning domains of high explanatory power (ICF Annex 9). The categories are intended to be used as a set. The set has been defined in a way that general and domain specific summary scores can be calculated using the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHO DAS 2.0) or the WHO Model Disability Survey (MDS).					
4343	3.2.28 Chapter X - Extension Codes					
4344	"This chapter is new. Extension codes are envisaged as providing the basis for postcoordination of ICD–11 codes, being the repository for all codes in a linearisation that are not eligible for use as stem codes."					
4345	"The different lists provide additional codes for clinical use as well as for injury research, device safety, drug safety, patient safety and cancer registration."					
4346	These codes are for optional use and will be used more likely in morbidity than in mortality.					
4347	3.3 Multiple Parenting					
4348	"An entity may be correctly classified in two different places, e.g. by site or by aetiology. For a disease like oesophageal cancer this would mean that it could be classified to cancers (malignant neoplasms) or to conditions of the digestive system. In the same way, cerebral ischaemic conditions could be classified to the vascular system – where the problem arises - or to the nervous system – where the ischaemia impacts and manifests with symptoms."					
4349	Indications of multiple parenting:					
4350	‘Excludes’ or ‘Code elsewhere’ note					
4351	Display of multiple parents in Foundation Component view					
4352	Display of multiple parents in tabular list. Example for oesophageal cancer: primary parent malignant neoplasm will appear in black and the digestive system for the oesophageal cancer in grey					
4353	"In the Foundation component, ‘excludes’ notes for these examples will mention possible parents (multiple parents). However, for the tabulation of statistical outputs from any tabular list, there can be only one parent for primary tabulation. When there are such multiple parents, in the Foundation Component view both parents will be displayed the same way. However, in a tabular list, the primary parent place will show the entity and its parents in black, and the secondary possible parent in grey."					
4354	"Every time an entity is parented elsewhere, it will continue to show the code from the primary parent. The primary parent is sometimes referred to as the ‘Tabular list parent’."					
4355	3.4 The Content Model					
4356	"The Content model is a structured framework that defines each entity found in the ICD in a standard way. The purpose of the Content model is to present the background knowledge that provides the basis for the description of each ICD entity in a systematic way to allow for computerisation. ICD–11 holds all of its content in the Foundation Component. Here, every entity is specified by a description, machine readable properties that have values, and one or more parent-child relationship(s). Additional links provide information for postcoordination. All of this multi-dimensional information is then combined to form a list with mutually exclusive categories - the tabular lists. The Foundation Component includes information on where and how a certain entity is represented in a tabular list. An entity might become a grouping, a category, or just a term that is, for example, listed in the index."					
4357	Each ICD entity can be seen from different dimensions. The Content Model represents each one of these dimensions as a ‘property’.					
4358	The key components of the descriptions of disease are included as different properties within the Content model. The main properties of the Content model are:					
4359	1. ICD Concept Title					
4360	"2. Hierarchy, Type and Use"					
4361	Parent					
4362	Type					
4363	Use					
4364	3. Textual Definition(s)					
4365	Description (short)					
4366	Definition (long)					
4367	4. Terms					
4368	Index terms					
4369	Synonyms Inclusion terms					
4370	Exclusion Terms					
4371	5. Clinical Descriptions					
4372	Body System(s)					
4373	Body Part(s) (Anatomical site(s))					
4374	Manifestation Properties					
4375	Signs and Symptoms					
4376	Findings					
4377	Causal Properties					
4378	Aetiology Type					
4379	Infection (agents)					
4380	Injury (mechanisms)					
4381	Risk Factors					
4382	Genomic Characteristics					
4383	Temporal Properties					
4384	Severity Properties					
4385	Functional Properties					
4386	Specific Condition Properties					
4387	Treatment Properties					
4388	Diagnostic Criteria					
4389	"For each ICD entity, various properties can be given if necessary to reach the correct coding result. A coder can use the properties to better understand a condition and how to code it, and the properties allow a coder to determine where a condition is placed. Only properties that are absolutely necessary have been defined in order to avoid the necessity of frequent updates. Additions of property values at the international level are managed through the regular update cycle whenever coding problems indicate the necessity to do so. The following is an example of the core properties:"					
4390	ICD entity: Invasive ductal carcinoma of breast					
4391	Properties	Value				
4392	Anatomy	Breast				
4393	Morphology	Invasive ductal carcinoma				
4394	The full range of different values for each given property is predefined using standard terminologies and ontologies. This range of values is called a ‘Value set’.					
4395	"Descriptions of ICD–11 entities inform analysts and translators about the meaning of an entity and its descriptive characteristics. There are two different types of descriptions: a short description (maximum of 100 words) that is available in both the content model and the tabular list, and a detailed description with comprehensive detail at the level required for each entity. The detailed description is labelled ‘additional information’ and appears only in online electronic versions. Coders are cautioned not to use the descriptions for coding. Coders must assign codes based on the diagnosis(es) documented by a clinician. However, the descriptor information that is included for the individual entities of the ICD-11 provides users of the ICD with clear insight regarding the intended meaning and scope of rubrics or terms in the tabular list and the Foundation Component. The descriptors guide translators, coders, and users of coded data. The goal is to enhance the comparability, consistency, and interpretation of coded information for everyone, everywhere. There are four levels of descriptor information in the ICD–11 content model:"					
4396	"Fully Specified Term - This is an unambiguous title that does not assume context. For example, ‘systemic illness with predominant gastrointestinal diarrhoeal symptoms attributable to vibrio cholera’, as opposed to ‘cholera’ or ‘other’ (where the meaning of other would have been clear from the hierarchical context)."					
4397	Short Description - The short description is a characterisation (maximum of 100 words) of the entity that states things that are always true about a disease or condition and which are necessary to understand the scope of the rubric. Descriptions do not necessarily contain elements intended for use in common epidemiology or things that are clinical criteria.					
4398	"Additional Information - This is a text field that is not mandatory, but that may contain additional information about, or characteristics of the diseases or conditions included in the entity. This text field provides more context for the entity. For example, the most common epidemiologic circumstances, putative or highly suspected aetiologic agents, or other information that may not always be true but may be common, typical, or expected."					
4399	Clinical or Diagnostic Criteria - It is intended to contain one or more scenarios of clinical criteria and characteristics that would be sufficient to diagnose the condition(s) or syndrome(s) of the given class or concept.					
4400	"Such scenarios will contain multiple variations, or embedded logic to accommodate ‘x out of n’ variations, that are necessary or useful to make the diagnosis. For example, a myocardial infarction (MI) in high-resource diagnostic settings would typically include a longitudinal pattern of cardiac enzymes, specific electrocardiogram changes, and stereotypical symptoms. However, only two out of these three needs to be present as there are such things as ‘silent MIs’ (without symptoms) and similar variations."					
4401	"It is expected that these scenarios will be divided over technology capabilities. For example, diagnosing a myocardial infarction in the high-resource diagnostic settings would likely involve different technology and criteria than in low-resource settings. ICD diagnostic criteria draw on various WHO guidelines that have identified diagnostic rules. Extensions to the ICD, as specialty linearisations, may use such diagnostic rules."					
4402	"The ICD-11 architecture, and the future evolution of this component of information, could eventually serve decision algorithms based on these criteria. Assignment of diagnoses and conditions could automatically be proposed from data arising in electronic medical records."					
4403	"Diagnostic criteria describes diagnostic methodology that determines how health providers diagnose cases that are classified to an entity. It contains the core diagnostic information necessary and sufficient to describe a category, and enables the digital representation of the diagnostic algorithms using standardised terminology and other elements as appropriate. There may be different sets of diagnostic criteria for different settings. Diagnostic criteria will draw on the content of other attributes."					
4404	3.5 Language independent ICD entities					
4405	"ICD-11 entities are language independent. All entities have a unique identifier or uniform resource identifier (URI) and have a specific place in a hierarchy of groups, categories and narrower terms. The maintenance of the ICD-11 on an international level is handled in the English language but the content model of the ICD–11 is language independent and allows binding of any desired language to the elements of its foundation. In this way, an international translation base facilitates translations and multilingual browsing. The URI remains valid independent of whether an ICD entity is still valid or has been retired. The hierarchical structure of groups, categories, subcategories, and inclusions (parents, children and narrower terms) serves also as a language independent backbone for translations of ICD. This structure is essential when building an index in a local language. It helps (in conjunction with the ICD translation platform) to identify the things that need to be translated in order to be able to address ICD categories with terms reported in the local language."					
4406	3.6 Innovation to mortality coding in ICD-11					
4407	"Mortality coding instructions of ICD have matured over time and basically has been maintained for ICD-11, while the text has been formatted using easier wordings to enhance common understandings and standardised implementation. Major changes in the classification have been incorporated in the mortality coding instructions."					
4408	"New concepts or terminology of ICD-11, for instance postcoordination or cluster coding, ‘code also’ and ‘use additional code if desired’ instructions will function to capture further information reported on the death certificate. In ICD-10 mortality coding, multiple cause coding, several modification rules in Step M4, or certain flags used in automated coding systems has been used to capture details reported on the death certificate and to facilitate accurate selection of underlying cause. And in this sense, it is considered that the function of postcoordination etc. has been embedded in ICD-10 mortality coding practice, while in ICD-11 the concepts are more evident and several new instruction were added to inform on how to apply these new concepts (see Part 2 of this Reference Guide)."					
4409	"The following table used in Step M1 for coding complications of diabetes mellitus is provided for optional use. This list is not a complete list of possible complications of diabetes mellitus, and is intended not to be updated but kept for users who are interested in consistency between ICD-10 and ICD-11 coding"

4518	3.7 Innovation to morbidity coding in ICD-11					
4519	‘Present on Admission’					
4520	The inclusion of the new Extension codes in ICD-11 provides capacity for coding qualifying information of linked stem codes. Among the new qualifying features is the particularly important status display feature that allows for distinction of diagnoses present at admission from diagnoses arising after hospital stay began.					
4521	3.8 Functioning section					
4522	An optional functioning section has been embedded in ICD-11 to enable the classification and measurement of the impact of health conditions in terms of functioning. For further information see section 1.1.6.2.					
4523	"Overall, the linkage between ICD-11 and ICF may assist with the following use cases:"					
4524	evaluation for general medical practice (e.g. work in capacity assessment)					
4525	evaluation for social benefits (e.g. disability pension)					
4526	payment or reimbursement purposes					
4527	"needs assessments (e.g. for rehabilitation, occupational assistance, long term care)"					
4528	outcome evaluation of interventions					
4529	"Wherever full functioning reporting is desired and required, the ICF should be used."					
4530	3.9 General features of ICD–11					
4531	"The main structural innovation of ICD–11 is that it is built on a Foundation Component from which the tabular list can be derived. The international reference tabular list is the statistical classification for morbidity and mortality. Due to the addition of a Foundation Component, and the electronic design of ICD-11, a new terminology had to be introduced that had not been used in prior versions of ICD. (See Section 2.13 for further information.)"					
4532	"For more detail on the terminology of ICD-11, see Section 1.1.6.1 Integrated use with Terminologies."					
4533	3.10 Traditional Medicine conditions - Module 1 (TM1)					
4534	"A large percentage of the world’s population uses some form of Traditional Medicine. However, standardised data and information on health status of these users remain largely absent from national and international health data collections. The use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapies has become a huge industry and is expected to grow. As a result of this gap in information about TM and the size of the industry, resources have been invested in the creation of a classification tool to allow data to be collected and analysed."					
4535	ICD-11’s supplementary chapter on Traditional Medicine disorders and patterns is designed to be integrated with coding of cases in conjunction with the Western Medicine concepts of ICD Chapters 1-25.					
4536	"As with other ICD chapters, the TM1 chapter is a tool for classifying, diagnosing, counting, communicating and comparing TM conditions, it will also assist research and evaluation to assess the safety and efficacy of TM. This chapter not judging TM practice or the efficacy of any TM intervention."					
4537	This chapter must not be used in mortality coding.					
4538	3.11 Preparations for the Eleventh Revision					
4539	"By 2003, it was becoming clear to the WHO and the Collaborating Centres that a further revision of the ICD could not be long delayed. The extent to which ICD updating could encapsulate emerging developments was limited by the structure of ICD–10, and some issues needed extended development and discussion with expert groups. A special meeting of Collaborating Centres in Helsinki in 2004 discussed the need for a revision and issues to be addressed as part of the revision process. The 2004 WHO-FIC meeting subsequently adopted a revision process work-plan which was progressively developed at ensuing meetings."					
4540	"In 2007, the WHO formally launched the revision process. Oversight has been provided through a broad-based Revision Steering Group. Technical work has been undertaken by a series of Technical Advisory Groups, with cross-cutting groups examining mortality, morbidity and quality and safety issues. For the first time, a chapter on description of diseases and patterns of diseases from a Traditional medicine standpoint has been included."					
4541	"A Content Model, including a range of components for each ICD entity has been developed, giving a rich foundation for the ICD. Other classifications and terminologies are linked or included where possible to ensure ICD is aligned with them, and items used in other members of the WHO Family of Classifications have been aligned wherever possible. The more traditional statistical classification for mortality and morbidity is obtained from the Foundation Component of ICD–11 as a Tabular list. Extension codes are used to limit content volume but still allow detailed classification of disease entities. Supplementary chapters and sections allow capturing on an optional basis information about traditional medicine diagnoses and functioning. Based on the experiences with ICD-9 and ICD-10 an updating mechanism was designed, that allows improvements in user guidance and scientific updates without compromising the statistical use of the classification."					
4542	"The revision of ICD-11 has taken place in several phases. First, a list of issues that were known from the use of ICD-10 and that could not be solved in its classification structure was compiled and possible solutions were formulated."					
4543	"Second, input was received from many scientific groups in the key subject areas, with a focus on clinical perspectives."					
4544	"Finally, centralised editing occurred, aimed to adjust imbalances in content generated by multiple, independently operating expert groups in the previous phase of the revision, and to ensure the overall structure is consistent and practicable for users for mortality and morbidity statistics. The final version also received input from field testing, Member State comments, and ongoing submission and processing of proposals."					
4545	3.12 Annex A: ICD-11 Updating and Maintenance					
4546	"This Annex describes the review process, the release cycles and the proposals workflow for updating ICD-11."					
4547	"Official releases of the ICD-11 classification are produced annually for international use in mortality and morbidity (this is known as the ‘blue browser’). By contrast, the ICD-11 Foundation Component is continuously updated. The updating is carried out at different levels with corresponding different frequencies."					
4548	"The ICD-11 is being released in five-yearly ‘stable’ versions for international use (contains updates that impact on the four- and five- character structure), unless urgent public health needs require otherwise. The releases are supplemented with version identifiers that are used for reporting in conjunction with the codes. Transition tables and materials showing the differences are provided with every version."					
4549	"Updates at a more detailed level than four- and five- characters can be published annually. Small error corrections that serve to clarify meaning, indexing or errors, may be communicated annually. Additions to the index can be done on an ongoing basis."					
4550	Mortality and morbidity rules will be updated in longer term cycles of every 10 years.					
4551	All countries that have implemented the ICD-11 are encouraged to adopt the updates in order to ensure greatest possible standardisation of coding results. If a country for whatever reason cannot implement a certain year of updates it shall at least ensure that the reported data is in line with the most recent version of ICD-11.					
4552	"The WHO has taken all reasonable precautions to verify the information contained in the ICD and its different versions and editions. However, the ICD is being distributed without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. The responsibility for the interpretation and use of ICD lies with the user. In no event shall the WHO be liable for damages arising from its use."					
4553	"The publisher of ICD-coded information is liable to ensure proper use of the ICD and present clearly the methodology for data collection and mechanisms that were used to modify the original data in order to indicate the comparability of the presented outcomes. For mortality data, no deviation from the methodology indicated in the ICD is permitted."					
4554	For information on taxonomy and structuring see 1.2.					
4555	A.6 Background					
4556	Updating ICD-11 makes sure that ICD meets the needs of users in content and terminology.					
4557	Updating and decisions follow the principles laid out in 1.2.1 Taxonomy.					
4558	"Updates include changes to chapters 01-24 of ICD, the supplementary chapter for traditional medicine conditions (including the development of additional modules), the supplementary section for functioning assessment, the extension codes, special views and special tabulation lists, elements of the foundation of ICD, as well as changes to the reference guide."					
4559	"All proposals are entered on an online maintenance platform, for verification of completeness, discussion and editing. The platform provides the infrastructure for routing proposals to reviewers and experts, and for providing feedback to the original authors. The maintenance platform also shows the final outcome of the proposal that has been entered in the authoring platform and become part of the ICD. Any individual user of the classification can submit a proposal for an update to the ICD. Such updates can refer to one or more entities of the ICD. They may address the position of entities in a tabular list, in the Foundation Component, and any element of the content model. The maintenance platform of ICD-11 (known as the ‘orange browser’) is used for proposals and comments. Any input to ICD-11 and its components requires proper referencing of sources, details of scientific evidence, and permission from the owner of any copyright materials (where applicable)."					
4560	The proposals will be reviewed by scientific experts and classification experts. The decision regarding the outcome of a particular proposal will be based on the recommendations by these experts.					
4561	"A workflow between a mortality reference group (MRG) and a morbidity reference group (MbRG), a medical scientific advisory committee (MSAC), and the overall overseeing classification and statistics advisory committee (CSAC) will ensure that all aspects concerning a proposal are considered. Reviews of the synthesis by classification experts ensure suitability of the proposed changes to the diverse use cases of the ICD."					
4562	"The process is based on consensus of the members of the CSAC about a proposed change. All rounds of editing will be handled through electronic platforms. Where consensus cannot be achieved, the proposal can either be deferred to subsequent cycles of editing pending arbitration by the WHO or be solved in a face-to-face meeting of classification and content experts. In all other cases, a consensus recommendation is given to WHO for final decision."					
4563	"All proposals for change must be submitted through the proposal mechanism to ensure a clear and transparent review of the proposed content. The different types of proposals that may move through a workflow in order to ensure consistency, structural integrity, and scientific correctness of the classification. The different workflows warrant proper use of the available resources of the WHO Family of International Classifications WHO-FIC Network and WHO. All changes are reported. Several steps may be needed for verification of updates."					
4564	A.7 Updating Cycle					
4565	The updating is carried out at different levels with different frequencies. That will keep stability for mortality and allow quicker updates for morbidity use.					
4566	Updates that impact on international reporting (the four and five-character structure of the stem codes) will be published every five years.					
4567	Updates at a more detailed level can be published at annual rates and pending the needs of clinical modifications also twice a year.					
4568	Additions to the index can be done on an ongoing basis.					
4569	"Mortality and morbidity rules will be updated in a 10-year
 cycle."					
4570	Other updates to the reference guide can be published at annual rates.					
4571	A.7.1 Types of proposals for ICD-11-MMS maintenance					
4572	"After reviewing the established proposal types and criteria of ICD-10 and those used thus far during ICD-11 Revision, taking into context the needs of ICD-11, the following proposal types for ICD-11 are proposed (see Table below for impact on Morbidity and Mortality Statistics (MMS))."					
4573	Add new entity:					
4574	to add an entity ‘below the shoreline’ (becoming an index entry in MMS)					
4575	to add an entity ‘above the shoreline’ (becoming a category in MMS)					
4576	Delete entity:					
4577	applicable to an entity below the shoreline (removing an index term from the MMS)					
4578	applicable to an entity above the shoreline (removing a category from the MMS)					
4579	Change of Coding Status:					
4580	"moving something from the index into the MMS (e.g. giving it an individual code), or moving something from the MMS to the index (e.g. eliminating the individual code and directing it elsewhere)"					
4581	Content Enhancement including the following subtypes:					
4582	"Change of Preferred Term (title) (Changes to a code that affect the meaning of that code are not allowed and will not be accepted. If a concept is outdated and must be updated, or a new concept is necessary, the relevant delete entity or add new entity proposal types, or both, must be used.)"					
4583	Addition / Deletion of a synonym					
4584	Addition / Deletion of an exclusion					
4585	Change of Description (Definition)					
4586	Change of Additional Information (Long Definition)					
4587	Correction of spelling or grammar (in any field)					
4588	Addition / Deletion of a mandatory postcoordination combination of stem codes					
4589	Addition / Deletion of entity rubric content (does not allow change to meaning)					
4590	Structural Change including the following subtypes:					
4591	Change a primary parent link					
4592	Change a secondary parent link					
4593	"Reference Guide Change applicable to any text of the ICD-11 Reference Guide, including coding rules and defaults, etc. Subtypes include:"					
4594	Correction of spelling or grammar					
4595	Clarification of a rule					
4596	"Change to a rule (that effects data integrity), including changing a coding hint"					
4597	Proposals for clarification that do not require change to the classification					
4598	Correction of inconsistency between volumes					
4599	"Ideally, each proposal will specify if it relates to the foundation or to a classification, including if it is for a national clinical modification or specialty linearisation. Tick boxes in the proposals will allow to indicate the scope."					
4600	"Not all authors will be familiar with these distinctions. The default may assume that the proposal relates to the ICD-11 MMS, unless specified otherwise. Regardless, the CSAC will need to determine if the item, once accepted, will be ‘above or below the shoreline’ in the ICD-11 MMS."					
4601	"Not all proposals will require the same level of scrutiny, as each may be considered in the context of its impact on the statistical classification and the desirability for a scientifically accurate and up-to-date classification. A ‘fast track’ to review urgently needed updates, such as for national clinical modifications will be put in place as needed. Criteria and a specific workflow exist for each ‘track’ used for proposals."

4645	A.8 Proposal completeness					
4646	"Any individual can submit a proposal for an update to the ICD. Proposals shall be provided in the format of a short (approximately 500-words) explanation with references to underpinning literature and evidence (publications in peer reviewed journals, or in official meetings of WHO, its CC or NGO in official relationships). The proposal shall also visualize the changes in the position and address potential impact on entities outside the proposal."					
4647	The author has to register with full name and affiliation and declare any possible conflict of interest.					
4648	"All proposals must have a clearly written and compelling rationale, with citations to establish the proposals’ evidence base."					
4649	"Proposals that suggest adding entities must have a description, and a description of the entity. This ensures the correct placement in the foundation. The rationale must have a scientific background, with references to publications in peer reviewed journals, or in official meetings of WHO, its CC or NGO in official relationships."					
4650	Proposals for new codes should include information about how the case would be coded if the proposed new code is not accepted.					
4651	Proposals with impact on the statistics must include a description or analysis of the resulting impact like frequency.					
4652	Proposals suggesting rule changes must come with an impact analysis.					
4653	An incomplete proposal will be returned to the author.					
4654	"The proposal mechanism will not allow submitting proposals without rationale or with missing description or definition, adequate to process the proposal."					
4655	A.9 Proposal Timelines					
4656	"Proposals can be submitted at any time. No impact proposals are processed on an ongoing basis, proposals requiring review by any of the groups and committees involved in the workflow, are bundled every 28 February of a year and routed in the necessary workflow."					
4657	"Proposals are processed in parallel by the relevant groups. Formal comments are provided in two rounds (two months, one month) -offering the opportunity for edits in between."					
4658	"Final decision about acceptance, rejection or ‘further discussion’ is taken at a teleconference of the CSAC at the WHO-FIC annual meeting in October every year. Official releases are published end of September for validity according to the updating cycle of the kind of proposal, earliest being proposals for adoption in January of the following year (minimum six months for translation, three months for formal dissemination, e.g. for clinical detail, secondary parents or synonyms)."					
4659	그림 Proposal and Release Timelines					
4660	A.10 Proposal Workflow					
4661	"ICD maintenance is a process that requires broad expertise in statistics and medical science as well as in different use cases. It has already been established that the structure associated with ICD update and maintenance will be revised in line with new requirements and efficient use of limited resources. The figure below shows the flow by which proposals received through the update platform might move through the expert groups for review and recommendation to WHO. A ‘proposal triage’ will initially review all proposals received to ensure that they are complete and have been submitted correctly. The proposals will then be forwarded to the appropriate next step(s). This triage may identify proposals that can or must be processed in an accelerated process, such as due to the type of proposal or in cases of extreme urgency. The proposed typology of proposals may help to identify the impact on the classification which will, in turn, inform whether the proposal is an improvement or clarification that can be implemented on an ongoing basis, or if the change must be queued for implementation on the updating cycle. The threshold for considering proposals to the foundation is low, allowing for simple rules to identify what is ‘receivable/actionable’ namely, if it is complete and correct, it may be considered. Consideration does not guarantee acceptance."					
4662	The CSAC is composed of:					
4663	WHO-FIC Collaborating centres and officially nominated technical representatives from WHO member states. The participants and observers have specific knowledge and expertise in the classifications					
4664	"Two cochairs from each Reference Group (Mortality Reference Group (MRG), Morbidity Reference Group (MbRG) and Functioning and Disability Reference Group (FDRG), Traditional Medicine Group (TMRG)) as well as two cochairs from the Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee (MSAC) are also included ex officio, with the right to comment but no right to vote."					
4665	Additional experts may be invited to participate in CSAC meetings for commenting on specific items.					
4666	All decisions are based on consensus. Terms of reference of the working groups are included in the document that describes the conduct of the WHO Family of International Classifications Network.					
4667	그림 Proposal Workflow					
4668	Proposal Workflow see [Conduct of the WHOFIC Network”] for ToR and Governance of the different groups.					
4669	CSAC Small Group					
4670	"This group consists of the CSAC co-chairs and secretariats, WHO staff and experts selected by WHO."					
4671	"The CSAC Small Group reviews each proposal and determines if the proposal is ready for review by the full CSAC. The Small Group also makes a recommendation by consensus as to whether the proposal should be accepted or rejected. If a proposal requires more information or is incomplete, the CSAC Small Group may request further advice from MSAC or other commit- tees and reference groups (C&RG) or send the proposal back to the author. Sometimes, the Small Group, MSAC and/or a C&RG make a recommendation for a modification to the original proposal, and this is recorded in the public comments section of the proposal by the secretariat of the group. These comments and proposed modifications are then considered by the full CSAC."					
4672	"When a proposal is ready for review by the wider CSAC, the CSAC Secretariat records the recommendation of the CSAC Small Group, and any suggested modifications and the reasons for these, on the public comments section of the proposal and allocates the proposal to have the status ‘CSAC Voting’. CSAC members can then indicate their agreement and/or comment on the proposal, as modified by the CSAC Small Group, as applicable."					
4673	A.11 Changes that cannot be done during the normal updating process					
4674	Changes that create new structures that conflict with the existing structure or coding of a current revision can be carried out only within a new revision of ICD and they include:					
4675	1. Changing an existing code of a category					
4676	2. Changing an existing grouping into a category if it has children in the linearisation (Allowing this would force changing the codes of the children therefore it is not allowed)					
4677	3. Changing an existing category into a grouping if it has children in the linearisation (Same as above)					
4678	4. Inserting a category in between two existing sibling categories. Categories to an existing siblinghood needs to be entered at the end before the residuals.					
4679	5. Re-ordering of any kind will not be possible as the ordering would be based on the codes which will not change.					
4680	6. Retiring an entity that contains children that are not retired and replacing it with another entity that contains the old children. (This is not possible because the new entity cannot keep the same code of the retired one and if we give a new code its code will not be compatible with the children.)					
4681	7. Moving an existing category in a way that would imply changing its code. E.g. the category 2B01.2 cannot be moved which is under 2B01 as a child of 2B00					
4682	For Chapter X ‘Extension codes’ the only limitation is number 1 above. Any other change could be done as the codes of Chapter X are not based on their hierarchical location.

4706	"A situation may arise, where a national government or a related national institution needs a modification to be implemented immediately. In such circumstances, conflicts with the current Foundation Component must be avoided, and the relevant changes will be subject to special mechanisms for the international updating process. All countries planning to produce modifications must make relevant contractual arrangements with WHO. This includes regulations on distribution within and outside the respective country and the resources necessary for the WHO to add such changes to the Foundation."					
4707	"For developing a national modification of ICD-11 the following rules must be adhered to: 1. Modifications will be agreed by the ICD-11 maintenance bodies before they are implemented nationally. 2. Modifications must not impact on morbidity and mortality statistics, and must not conflict with the Foundation. 3. Approval of all modifications will be subject to consideration of whether suitable additional detail already exists in the Foundation. 4. If a change is made to the international version of ICD-11 the respective modification must incorporate the change as soon as possible."					
4708	Example					
4709	"‘Diabetes Type 1’ in the WHO version of ICD-11 is classified to 5A10. A national modification may require additional detail to be added to the ICD-11 codes. For example, ‘Diabetes Type 1, uncontrolled’ could be added as a subcategory to 5A10, as 5A10.1 Diabetes Type 1, uncontrolled. However, when the mechanism of postcoordination provides the necessary detail, the addition of a new subcategory may not be necessary."					
4710	3.13 Annex B: History of the development of the ICD					
4711	3.13.1 Early history					
4712	"Sir George Knibbs, the eminent Australian statistician, credited François Bossier de Lacroix (1706-1777), better known as Sauvages, with the first attempt to classify diseases systematically (1). Sauvages’ comprehensive treatise was published under the title Nosologia methodica. A contemporary of Sauvages was the great methodologist Linnaeus (1707-1778), author of Genera morborum, a catalogue of diseases. More recently, Moriyama et al (2) have referred to 16th century and 17th predecessors Fernel and Sydenham. At the beginning of the 19th century, the classification of disease in most general use was one by William Cullen (1710- 1790, of Edinburgh, which was published in 1785 under the title Synopsis nosologiae methodicae."					
4713	"For all practical purposes, however, the statistical study of disease began a century earlier with the work of John Graunt on the London Bills of Mortality published in 1662. The kind of classification envisaged by this pioneer is exemplified by his attempt to estimate the proportion of liveborn children who died before reaching the age of six, when no records of age at death were available. He took all deaths and classed them using terms from the time, such as thrush, convulsions, rickets, teeth and worms, abortives, chrysomes, infants, and livergrown. Overlaid with these, he added to them deaths classed as smallpox, swinepox, measles, and worms without convulsions. Despite the crudity of this classification, his estimate of 36% mortality before the age of six years appears from later evidence to have been a good one. While three centuries have contributed to the scientific accuracy of disease classification, there are many who doubt the usefulness of attempts to compile statistics of disease, or even causes of death, because of the difficulties of classification. To these, one can quote Major Greenwood: ‘The scientific purist, who will wait for medical statistics until they are nosologically exact, is no wiser than Horace’s rustic waiting for the river to flow away’ (3)."					
4714	"Fortunately for the progress of preventive medicine, the General Register Office of England and Wales, at its inception in 1837, found in William Farr (1807-1883) – its first medical statistician. Farr was a man who not only made the best possible use of the imperfect classifications of disease available at the time but laboured to secure better classifications and international uniformity in their use."					
4715	"Farr found Cullen’s classification in use in the public services. It had not been revised to embody the advances in medical science, nor was it deemed by him to be satisfactory for statistical purposes. Farr realised that small numbers that would result from a detailed classification would not permit statistical inferences to be made. In the first Annual Report of the Registrar General (4), therefore, he discussed the principles that should govern a statistical classification of disease and urged the adoption of a uniform classification as follows:"					
4716	"_The advantages of a uniform statistical nomenclature, however imperfect, are so obvious, that it is surprising no attention has been paid to its enforcement in Bills of Mortality. Each disease has, in many instances, been denoted by three or four terms, and each term has been applied to as many different diseases: vague, inconvenient names have been employed, or complications have been registered instead of primary diseases. The nomenclature is of as much importance in this department of inquiry as weights and measures in the physical sciences, and should be settled without delay._"					
4717	"Both nomenclature and statistical classification received constant study and consideration by Farr in his annual ‘Letters’ to the Registrar General published in the Annual Reports of the Registrar General. Farr did much to promote his classification but could not find general acceptance (4). However, the utility of a uniform classification of causes of death was so strongly recognised at the first International Statistical Congress, held in Brussels in 1853, that the Congress requested William Farr and Genevan Marc d’Espine to prepare an internationally applicable, uniform classification of causes of death."					
4718	"At the next Congress, in Paris in 1855, Farr and d’Espine submitted two separate lists which were based on very different principles. Farr’s classification was arranged under five groups: epidemic diseases, constitutional (general) diseases, local diseases arranged according to anatomical site, developmental diseases, and diseases that are the direct result of violence. D’Espine classified diseases according to their nature (gouty, herpetic, haematic, etc.). The Congress adopted a compromise list of 139 rubrics. In 1864, this classification was revised in Paris on the basis of Farr’s model and was subsequently further revised in 1874, 1880, and 1886. Although this classification was never universally accepted, the general arrangement proposed by Farr, including the principle of classifying diseases by aetiology followed by anatomical site, survived as the basis of the International List of Causes of Death."					
4719	"Importantly, the 1855 Congress also recommended that each country should ask for information on causes of death from the doctor who had been attending the deceased, and that each country should take measures to ensure that all deaths were verified by doctors (4)."					
4720	3.13.2 Adoption of the International List of Causes of Death					
4721	"At its 1891 meeting in Vienna, the International Statistical Institute, the successor to the International Statistical Congress, charged a committee chaired by Jacques Bertillon (1851- 1922), Chief of Statistical Services of the City of Paris, with the preparation of a classification of causes of death. The committee’s report was presented and adopted at the meeting of the International Statistical Institute in Chicago in 1893."					
4722	"For main headings, Bertillon adopted the anatomical site rather than the nature of disease, according to Farr’s plan. Bertillon’s list included defined diseases most worthy of study by reason of their transmissible nature or their frequency of occurrence. In accordance with the instructions of the Vienna Congress, Bertillon included three classifications: an abridged classification of 44 titles; a classification of 99 titles; and a classification of 161 titles. Bertillon also prepared some rules or guidelines on the resolution of problems; for example, how statistical clerks should classify what is written without imputing what the doctor might have meant (5). The ‘Bertillon Classification of Causes of Death’, as it was first called, received general approval and was adopted by several countries, as well as by many cities. The classification was first used in North America by Jesus E. Monjaras for the statistics of San Luis de Potosi, Mexico (5). In 1898, the American Public Health Association, at its meeting in Ottawa, Canada, recommended the adoption of the Bertillon Classification by registrars of Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America. The Association further suggested that the classification should be revised every ten years."					
4723	"At the meeting of the International Statistical Institute at Christiania in 1899, Bertillon presented a report on the progress of the classification, including the recommendations of the American Public Health Association for decennial revisions. The International Statistical Institute then adopted the following resolution (6): The International Statistical Institute, convinced of the necessity of using comparable nomenclatures in the different countries:"					
4724	"_Learns with pleasure of the adoption by all the statistical offices of North America, by some of those of South America, and by some in Europe, of the system of cause of death nomenclature presented in 1893; Insists vigorously that this system of nomenclature be adopted in principle and without revision, by all the statistical institutions of Europe; Approves, at least in its general lines, the system of decennial revision proposed by the American Public Health Association at its Ottawa session (1898); Urges the statistical offices who have not yet adhered, to do so without delay, and to contribute to the comparability of the cause of death nomenclature._"					
4725	"The French Government therefore assembled in Paris, in August 1900, the first International Conference for the Revision of the Bertillon or International List of Causes of Death. Delegates from 26 countries attended this Conference. A detailed classification of causes of death consisting of 179 groups and an abridged classification of 35 groups was adopted on 21 August 1900. The desire for decennial revisions was recognized, and the French Government was requested to call the next meeting in 1910. In fact, the next conference was held in 1909, and the Government of France called succeeding conferences in 1920, 1929, and 1938. Bertillon continued to be the guiding force in the promotion of the International List of Causes of Death, and the revisions of 1900, 1910, and 1920 were carried out under his leadership. As Secretary- General of the International Conference, he sent out the provisional revision for 1920 to more than 500 people, asking for comments. His death in 1922 left the International Conference without a guiding hand."					
4726	"At the 1923 session of the International Statistical Institute, Michel Huber, Bertillon’s successor in France, recognized this lack of leadership and introduced a resolution for the International Statistical Institute to renew its stand of 1893 in regard to the International Classification of Causes of Death and to cooperate with other international organisations in preparation for subsequent revisions. The Health organisation of the League of Nations had also taken an active interest in vital statistics and appointed a Commission of Statistical Experts to study the classification of diseases and causes of death, as well as other problems in the field of medical statistics. E. Roesle, Chief of the Medical Statistical Service of the German Health Bureau and a member of the Commission of Statistical Experts, prepared a monograph that listed the expansion in the rubrics of the 1920 International List of Causes of Death that would be required if the classification were to be used in the tabulation of statistics of morbidity. This careful study was published by the Health organisation of the League of Nations in 1928 (7). In order to coordinate the work of both agencies, an international ‘Mixed Commission’ was created with an equal number of representatives from the International Statistical Institute and the Health organisation of the League of Nations. This Commission drafted the proposals for the Fourth (1929) and the Fifth (1938) revisions of the International List of Causes of Death."					
4727	3.13.3 The Fifth Decennial Revision Conference					
4728	"The Fifth International Conference for the Revision of the International List of Causes of Death, like the preceding conferences, was convened by the Government of France and was held in Paris in October 1938. The Conference approved three lists: a detailed list of 200 titles, an intermediate list of 87 titles and an abridged list of 44 titles. Apart from bringing the lists up to date in accordance with the progress of science, particularly in the chapter on infectious and parasitic diseases, and changes in the chapters on puerperal conditions and on accidents, the Conference made as few changes as possible in the contents, number, and even in the numbering of the items. A list of causes of stillbirth was also drawn up and approved by the Conference."					
4729	"As regards classification of diseases for morbidity statistics, the Conference recognised the growing need for a corresponding list of diseases to meet the statistical requirements of widely differing organisations, such as health insurance organisations, hospitals, military medical services, health administrations, and similar bodies. The following resolution, therefore, was adopted (8):"					
4730	3.13.3.1 International Lists of Diseases					
4731	"In view of the importance of the compilation of international lists of diseases corresponding to the international lists of causes of death: The Conference recommends that the Joint Committee appointed by the International Institute of Statistics and the Health organisation of the League of Nations undertake, as in 1929, the preparation of international lists of diseases, in conjunction with experts and representatives of the organisations specially concerned. Pending the compilation of international lists of diseases, the Conference recommends that the various national lists in use should, as far as possible, be brought into line with the detailed International List of Causes of Death (the numbers of the chapters, headings and subheadings in the said List being given in brackets). The Conference further recommended that the United States Government continue its studies of the statistical treatment of joint causes of death in the following resolution (9):"					
4732	"o Death Certificate and Selection of Causes of Death where more than One Cause is given (Joint Causes) The Conference,"					
4733	"ㆍWhereas, in 1929, the United States Government was good enough to undertake the study of the means of unifying the methods of selection of the main cause of death to be tabulated in those cases where two or more causes are mentioned on the death certificate,"					
4734	"ㆍAnd whereas, the numerous surveys completed or in the course of preparation in several countries reveal the importance of this problem, which has not yet been solved,"					
4735	"ㆍAnd whereas, according to these surveys, the international comparability of death rates from the various diseases requires, not only the solution of the problem of the selection of the main tabulated cause of death, but also the solution of several other questions;"					
4736	o Warmly thanks the United States Government for the work it has accomplished or promoted in this connection;					
4737	"• Requests the United States Government to continue its investigations during the next ten years, in cooperation with other countries and organisations, on a slightly wider basis, and"					
4738	"• Suggests that, for these future investigations, the United States Government should set up a subcommittee comprising representatives of countries and organisations participating in the investigations undertaken in this connection."					
4739	3.13.4 Previous classifications of diseases for morbidity statistics					
4740	"In the discussion so far, classification of disease has been presented almost wholly in relation to cause-of-death statistics. Farr, however, recognized that it was desirable “to extend the same system of nomenclature to diseases which, though not fatal, cause disability in the population, and now figure in the tables of the diseases of armies, navies, hospitals, prisons, lunatic asylums, public institutions of every kind, and sickness societies, as well as in the census of countries like Ireland, where the diseases of all the people are enumerated” (10). In his ‘Report on nomenclature and statistical classification of diseases’, presented to the Second International Statistical Congress, he therefore included in the general list of diseases most of those diseases that affect health as well as diseases that are fatal. At the Fourth International Statistical Congress, held in London in 1860, Florence Nightingale urged the adoption of Farr’s classification of diseases for the tabulation of hospital morbidity in the paper, ‘Proposals for a uniform plan of hospital statistics’."					
4741	"At the First International Conference to revise the Bertillon Classification of Causes of Death in Paris in 1900, a parallel classification of diseases for use in statistics of sickness was adopted. A parallel list was also adopted at the second conference in 1909. The extra categories for non-fatal diseases were formed by subdivision of certain rubrics of the cause-of-death classification into two or three disease groups, each of these being designated by a letter. The translation in English of the Second Decennial Revision, published by the United States Department of Commerce and Labor in 1910, was entitled International Classification of Causes of Sickness and Death. Later revisions incorporated some of the groups into the detailed International List of Causes of Death. The Fourth International Conference adopted a classification of illness which differed from the detailed International List of Causes of Death only by the addition of further subdivisions of 12 titles. These international classifications of illnesses, however, failed to receive general acceptance, as they provided only a limited expansion of the basic cause-of-death list."					
4742	"In the absence of a uniform classification of diseases that could be used satisfactorily for statistics of illness, many countries found it necessary to prepare their own lists. A Standard Morbidity Code was prepared by the Dominion Council of Health of Canada and published in 1936. The main subdivisions of this code represented the 18 chapters of the 1929 Revision of the International List of Causes of Death, and these were subdivided into some 380 specific disease categories. At the Fifth International Conference in 1938, the Canadian delegate introduced a modification of this list for consideration as the basis for an international list of causes of illness. Although no action was taken on this proposal, the Conference adopted the resolution quoted above."					
4743	"In 1944, provisional classifications of diseases and injuries were published in both the United Kingdom and the United States for use in the tabulation of morbidity statistics. Both classifications were more extensive than the Canadian list, but, like it, followed the general order of diseases in the International List of Causes of Death. The British classification was prepared by the Committee on Hospital Morbidity Statistics of the Medical Research Council, which was created in January 1942. It is entitled ‘A provisional classification of diseases and injuries for use in compiling morbidity statistics’ (8). It was prepared with the purpose of providing a scheme for collecting and recording statistics of patients admitted to hospitals in the United Kingdom, using a standard classification of diseases and injuries, and was used throughout the country by governmental and other agencies."					
4744	"A few years earlier, in August 1940, the Surgeon-General of the United States Public Health Service and the Director of the United States Bureau of the Census published a list of diseases and injuries for tabulation of morbidity statistics (9). The code was prepared by the Division of Public Health Methods of the Public Health Service in cooperation with a committee of consultants appointed by the Surgeon-General. ‘The Manual for coding causes of illness according to a diagnosis code for tabulating morbidity statistics’, consisting of the diagnosis code, a tabular list of inclusions, and an alphabetical index, was published in 1944. The code was used in several hospitals, in a large number of voluntary hospital insurance plans and medical care plans, and in special studies by other agencies in the United States."					
4745	3.13.5 United States Committee on Joint Causes of Death					
4746	"In compliance with the resolution of the Fifth International Conference, the American Secretary of State in 1945 appointed the United States Committee on Joint Causes of Death under the chairmanship of Lowell J. Reed, Professor of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. Members and consultants of this committee included representatives of the Governments of Canada and the United Kingdom and the Health Section of the League of Nations. Recognizing a trend, the committee decided that it would be advantageous to consider classifications from the point of view of morbidity and mortality, since the problem of joint causes pertained to both types of statistics."					
4747	"The committee also took into account that part of the resolution on International Lists of Diseases of the previous International Conference recommending that the ‘various national lists in use should, as far as possible, be brought into line with the detailed International List of Causes of Death’. It recognized that the classification of sickness and injury is closely linked with the classification of causes of death. The view that such lists are fundamentally different arises from the erroneous belief that the International List is a classification of terminal causes, whereas it is in fact based upon the morbid condition that initiated the train of events ultimately resulting in death. The committee believed that, in order to utilise fully both morbidity and mortality statistics, not only should the classification of diseases for both purposes be comparable, but if possible, there should be a single list."					
4748	"Furthermore, an increasing number of statistical organisations were using medical records involving both sickness and death. Even in organisations that compile only morbidity statistics, fatal as well as non-fatal cases needed to be coded. A single list, therefore, greatly facilitates their coding operations. It also provides a common base for comparison of morbidity and mortality statistics."					
4749	"A subcommittee was therefore appointed, which prepared a draft of a Proposed Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries and Causes of Death. A final draft was adopted by the committee after it had been modified on the basis of trials undertaken by various agencies in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States of America."

4758	3.13.6 Sixth Revision of the International Lists					
4759	"The International Health Conference held in New York City in June and July 1946 (11) entrusted the Interim Commission of the World Health Organisation with the responsibility of ‘reviewing the existing machinery and of undertaking such preparatory work as may be necessary in connection with: (i) the next decennial revision of ‘The International Lists of Causes of Death’ (including the lists adopted under the International Agreement of 1934, relating to Statistics of Causes of Death); and (ii) the establishment of International Lists of Causes of Morbidity.’"					
4760	"To meet this responsibility, the Interim Commission appointed the Expert Committee for the Preparation of the Sixth Decennial Revision of the International Lists of Diseases and Causes of Death. This Committee, taking full account of prevailing opinion concerning morbidity and mortality classification, reviewed and revised the above-mentioned proposed classification which had been prepared by the United States Committee on Joint Causes of Death."					
4761	"The resulting classification was circulated to national governments preparing morbidity and mortality statistics for comments and suggestions under the title, International Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death. The Expert Committee considered the replies and prepared a revised version incorporating changes to improve the utility and acceptability of the classification. The Committee also compiled a list of diagnostic terms to appear under each title of the classification. Furthermore, a subcommittee was appointed to prepare a comprehensive alphabetical index of diagnostic statements classified to the appropriate category of the classification. The Committee also considered the structure and uses of special lists of causes for tabulation and publication of morbidity and mortality statistics and studied other problems related to the international comparability of mortality statistics, such as form of medical certificate and rules for classification. The International Conference for the Sixth Revision of the International Lists of Diseases and Causes of Death was convened in Paris from 26 to 30 April 1948 by the Government of France under the terms of the agreement signed at the close of the Fifth Revision Conference in 1938. Its secretariat was entrusted jointly to the competent French authorities and to the World Health Organisation, which had carried out the preparatory work under the terms of the arrangement concluded by the governments represented at the International Health Conference in 1946 (12)."					
4762	"The Conference adopted the classification prepared by the Expert Committee as the Sixth Revision of the International Lists (13). It also considered other proposals of the Expert Committee concerning the compilation, tabulation and publication of morbidity and mortality statistics. The Conference approved the International Form of Medical Certificate of Cause of Death, accepted the underlying cause of death as the main cause to be tabulated, and endorsed the rules for selecting the underlying cause of death as well as the special lists for tabulation of morbidity and mortality data. It further recommended that the World Health Assembly should adopt regulations under Article 21(b) of the WHO Constitution to guide Member States in compiling morbidity and mortality statistics in accordance with the International Statistical Classification. In 1948, the First World Health Assembly endorsed the report of the Sixth Revision Conference and adopted World Health Organisation Regulations No. 1, devised based on the recommendations of the Conference. The International Classification, including the Tabular List of Inclusions defining the content of the categories, was incorporated, together with the form of the medical certificate of cause of death, the rules for classification and the special lists for tabulation, into the Manual of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death (22). The Manual consisted of two volumes, Volume 2 being an alphabetical index of diagnostic terms coded to the appropriate categories. In the Sixth Revision, morbid conditions resulting from injuries, poisonings and other external causes were classified according to both the external circumstances giving rise to the injury and to the kind of injury."					
4763	"The adoption of this dual classification was regarded at the time as a bold step to deal with the simultaneous interest in more than one aspect of injury. The Sixth Decennial Revision Conference marked the beginning of a new era in international vital and health statistics. Apart from approving a comprehensive list for both mortality and morbidity and agreeing on international rules for selecting the underlying cause of death, it recommended the adoption of a comprehensive programme of international cooperation in the field of vital and health statistics. An important item in this programme was the recommendation that governments establish national committees on vital and health statistics to coordinate the statistical activities in the country, and to serve as a link between the national statistical institutions and the World Health Organisation. It was further envisaged that such national committees would, either singly or in cooperation with other national committees, study statistical problems of public health importance and make the results of their investigations available to the WHO."					
4764	3.13.7 The Seventh and Eighth Revisions					
4765	"The International Conference for the Seventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases was held in Paris under the auspices of the WHO in February 1955 (14). In accordance with a recommendation of the WHO Expert Committee on Health Statistics, this revision was limited to essential changes and amendments of errors and inconsistencies (15). The Eighth Revision Conference convened by the WHO met in Geneva, from 6 to 12 July 1965 (16). This revision was more radical than the Seventh but left unchanged the basic structure of the Classification and the general philosophy of classifying diseases, whenever possible, according to their aetiology rather than a particular manifestation. During the years that the Seventh and Eighth Revisions of the ICD were in force, the use of the ICD for indexing hospital medical records increased rapidly and some countries prepared national adaptations which provided the additional detail needed for this application of the ICD."					
4766	3.13.8 The Ninth Revision					
4767	"The International Conference for the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, convened by the WHO, met in Geneva from 30 September to 6 October 1975 (17). In the discussions leading up to the conference, it had originally been intended that there should be little change other than updating of the classification. This was mainly because of the expense of adapting data processing systems each time the classification was revised. There had been an enormous growth of interest in the ICD and ways had to be found of responding to this, partly by modifying the classification itself and partly by introducing special coding provisions."					
4768	"A number of representations were made by specialist bodies which had become interested in using the ICD for their own statistics. Some subject areas in the classification were regarded as inappropriately arranged and there was considerable pressure for more detail and for adaptation of the classification to make it more relevant for the evaluation of medical care, by classifying conditions to the chapters concerned with the part of the body affected rather than to those dealing with the underlying generalised disease. At the other end of the scale, there were representations from countries and areas where a detailed and sophisticated classification was irrelevant, but which nevertheless needed a classification based on the ICD in order to assess their progress in health care and in the control of disease. The final proposals presented to and accepted by the Conference retained the basic structure of the ICD, although with much additional detail at the level of the four-digit subcategories, and some optional five-digit subdivisions. For the benefit of users not requiring such detail, care was taken to ensure that the categories at the three-digit level were appropriate."					
4769	"For the benefit of users wishing to produce statistics and indexes oriented towards medical care, the Ninth Revision included an optional alternative method of classifying diagnostic statements, including information about both an underlying general disease and a manifestation in a particular organ or site. This system became known as the dagger and asterisk system. The Twenty Ninth World Health Assembly, noting the recommendations of the International Conference for the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, approved the publication, for trial purposes, of supplementary classifications of Impairments and Handicaps and of Procedures in Medicine as supplements to, but not as integral parts of, the International Classification of Diseases."					
4770	3.13.9 The Tenth Revision					
4771	"Even before the Conference for the Ninth Revision, the WHO had been preparing for the Tenth Revision. It recognised that the great expansion in the use of the ICD necessitated a thorough rethinking of its structure and an effort to devise a stable and flexible classification, which should not require fundamental revision for many years to come. The WHO Collaborating Centres for Classification of Diseases (see www.who.int/classification) were consequently called upon to experiment with models of alternative structures for ICD–10."					
4772	"It had also become clear that the established ten-year interval between revisions was too short. Work on the revision process had to start before the current version of the ICD had been in use long enough to be thoroughly evaluated, mainly because the necessity to consult so many countries and organisations made the process a very lengthy one. The Director General of the WHO therefore wrote to the Member States and obtained their agreement to postpone a 1985 Tenth Revision Conference until 1989, and to delay the introduction of the Tenth Revision which would have been due in 1989. In addition to permitting experimentation with alternative models for the structure of the ICD, this allowed time for the evaluation of ICD-9, for example through meetings organised by some of the WHO Regional Offices and through a survey organised at headquarters."					
4773	"The International Conference for the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, attended by delegates from 43 Member States, was convened by the World Health organisation in Geneva from 26 September to 2 October 1989. The United Nations, the International Labour Organisation, and the WHO Regional Offices sent representatives to participate in the Conference, as did the Council for International organisations of Medical Sciences. Twelve other non-governmental organisations concerned with cancer registration, the deaf, epidemiology, family medicine, gynaecology and obstetrics, hypertension, health records, preventive and social medicine, neurology, psychiatry, rehabilitation and sexually transmitted diseases were also invited."					
4774	"Extensive preparatory activity had been devoted to a radical review of the suitability of the structure of the ICD, essentially a statistical classification of diseases and other health problems, to serve a wide variety of needs for mortality and health care data. Ways of stabilizing the coding system to minimize disruption at successive revisions had been investigated, as had the possibility of providing a better balance between the content of the different chapters of the ICD. Even with a new structure, it was plain that one classification could not cope with the extremes of the requirements. The concept had therefore been developed of a ‘family’ of classifications, which would include the ICD for traditional mortality and morbidity statistics, while needs for more detailed, less detailed or different classifications and associated matters would be dealt with by other members of the family. The potential for different members of the ‘family’ in the medico-social and multi-dimensional assessment in relation not only to health but also to activities of daily living, as well as the social and physical environment, was recognised. It was demonstrated that effective information could be obtained through use of the ICD and the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities, and Handicaps (ICIDH) (18), and through use of the codes from Chapter XXI of the Tenth Revision."					
4775	"The main innovation in the Tenth Revision was the use of an alphanumeric coding scheme of one letter followed by three numbers at the four-character level. This had the effect of more than doubling the size of the coding frame in comparison with the Ninth Revision and enabled the vast majority of chapters to be assigned a unique letter or group of letters, each capable of providing 100 three-character categories. Of the 26 available letters, 25 had been used, the letter U being left vacant for future additions and changes, and for possible interim classifications to solve difficulties arising at the national and international level between revisions."					
4776	"Another important innovation was the creation towards the end of certain chapters of categories for postprocedural disorders. These identified important conditions that constituted a medical care problem in their own right. Postprocedural conditions that were not specific to a particular body system continued to be classified in the chapter on ‘Injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes’. The Revision included definitions, standards, and reporting requirements related to maternal mortality and to fetal, perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality. It was published in three volumes: one containing the Tabular List, a second containing all related definitions, standards, rules and instructions, and a third containing the Alphabetical Index."					
4777	"The Tenth Revision Conference discussed the difficulties experienced during the extended period of use of the Ninth Revision, related to the emergence of new diseases and the lack of an updating mechanism to accommodate them. It recognised that it would not be feasible to hold revision conferences more frequently than every 10 years. It also recognised that any changes introduced during the lifetime of the Tenth Revision would need to be considered carefully in relation to their impact on analyses and trends."					
4778	3.13.10 The WHO Family of International Classifications					
4779	"Although the ICD is suitable for many different applications, it does not serve all the needs of its various users. It does not provide sufficient detail for some specialties and sometimes information on different attributes of health conditions may be needed. Also, the ICD is not useful to describe functioning and disability as aspects of health and does not include a full array of health interventions or reasons for encounter. Foundations laid by the International Conference on ICD–10 in 1989 provided the basis for the development of a ‘family’ of health classifications. This was given added momentum during the 1990s by the development of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) (19), approved by the World Health Assembly in 2001."					
4780	"In 2001, the WHO Family of International Classifications (WHO-FIC) was created. At the core of the Family are its reference classifications, currently the ICD and the ICF; the International Classification of Health Interventions (ICHI), now under development, is the third reference classification. The WHO-FIC also includes derived classifications, which provide additional detail to core classifications or are rearrangements or aggregations of terms in core classifications; the WHO has licensed several countries to develop national modifications of the ICD as derived classifications. As well, the WHO-FIC includes related classifications to cover health functions which are not (or are only partially) covered by other WHO-FIC members. The WHO-FIC is supported by a network of Collaborating Centres, based on the former Collaborating Centres for the ICD and the ICF, but continuously expanded by the addition of new centres."

4796	"As foreshadowed at the Tenth Revision conference, updating of the tenth revision of ICD commenced in 2000. Updating proposals came from, and were carefully considered by, the WHO and Collaborating Centres, including the impact on trends. The updating process has allowed an extended life for the Tenth Revision while maintaining its clinical and scientific currency."					
4797	3.13.12 Major Steps in the ICD-11 Revision					
4798	"The revision of ICD-11 has taken place in several phases. First; a list of issues that were known from the use of ICD-10 and that could not be solved in its classification structure was compiled and possible solutions were formulated. Second; input was received from many scientific groups in the key subject areas, with a focus on clinical perspectives."					
4799	"Finally, centralised editing occurred, aimed at adjusting imbalances in content generated by multiple, independently operating expert groups in the previous phase of the revision, and at ensuring consistency and practicability of the overall structure for mortality and morbidity statistics."					
4800	"The final version also received input from field testing, Member State comments, and ongoing submissions and processing of proposals."					
4801	3.13.13 Preparations for the Eleventh Revision					
4802	"By 2003, it was becoming clear to the WHO and the Collaborating Centres that a further revision of the ICD could no longer be delayed. The extent to which ICD updating could encapsulate emerging developments was limited by the structure of ICD–10, and some issues needed extended development and discussion with expert groups. A special meeting of Collaborating Centres in Helsinki in 2004 discussed the need for a revision and issues to be addressed as part of the revision process. The 2004 WHO-FIC meeting subsequently adopted a revision process work-plan which was progressively developed at ensuing meetings."					
4803	"In 2007, the WHO formally launched the revision process. Oversight has been provided through a broad-based Revision Steering Group. Technical work has been undertaken by a series of Topic Advisory Groups, with cross-cutting groups examining mortality, morbidity and quality and safety issues. For the first time, a chapter on description of diseases and patterns of diseases from a traditional medicine standpoint has been included."					
4804	"A Content Model, including a range of components for each ICD entity has been developed, giving a rich foundation for the ICD. Other classifications and terminologies are linked or included where possible to ensure ICD is aligned with them, and items used in other members of the WHO Family of Classifications have been aligned wherever possible. The more traditional statistical classification for mortality and morbidity is obtained from the Foundation Component of ICD–11 as a tabular list. Extension codes are used to limit content volume but still allow detailed classification of disease entities. Supplementary chapters and sections allow capturing on an optional basis information about traditional medicine diagnoses and functioning. Based on the experiences with ICD-9 and ICD-10 an updating mechanism was designed, that allows improvements in user guidance and scientific updates without compromising the statistical use of the classification."

4828	그림					
4829	 The International Form of Medical Certificate of Cause of Death					
4830	"Additional data that might be necessary for the reporting system of countries can be added to the certificate. The form has a Frame A that serves to report the cause(s) of death, the sequence of causes, the duration of diseases until death, and other conditions contributing to death. Causes of death should be reported with the best available detail. For example, ‘birth depression’ for a newborn child that died, should be complemented by the reason for the birth depression, as intrapartum asphyxia, or prepartum hypoxaemia."					
4831	"The Frame B is designed to help to report detail that is relevant to coding and epidemiology analyses for deaths due to external causes, maternal deaths, perinatal deaths, and deaths due to postprocedural conditions. It complements the information in Frame A. The complete reporting of the causes of death is based on an accurate examination of the dead body, the assessment of local circumstances and insight available from health records. Correct establishment of a cause of death and completion of the death certificate requires training that should start at medical school and be refreshed in regular education programmes. Also important is the practical experience in death certification that is gained under the supervision of more experienced colleagues. It is noted that medical certifiers that establish the cause of death may not always be available. Certification by non- physicians may result in a changed pattern of the reported causes of death."					
4832	"Where the dead body is no longer available for examination, for example due to low coverage of medical staff or traditional rapid burial procedures, a verbal autopsy may provide some limited information on the cause of death. In such a case, a sequence of causes that led to death will rarely be identified, and causes identified with verbal autopsy should be reported separately to those available from formal death certification process."					
4833	3.14.2 Quick reference guide for the International form of medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD flyer)					
4834	Cause of death information serves					
4835	• epidemiology and prevention					
4836	• managing health care					
4837	• comparing health in different populations					
4838	"Certification of death is one of the first steps in getting an overview of the health of people. The diseases or conditions recorded on a death certificate represent the best medical opinion. A properly completed cause-of-death certificate provides a description of the order, type and association of events that have resulted in the death. The diagnoses reported on the certificate are coded with the International Classification of Diseases. The filling in of the cause-of-death certificate is independent of the revision of ICD. This coded data is analyzed and used both nationally and internationally no matter what language was used to complete the certification."					
4839	Cause of Death on the certificate - how to fill in?					
4840	"Frame A: Death certificates may look different in most countries. But the section on the cause of death is identical worldwide. Frame A has two parts, called Part 1 and Part 2, and a section to record the time interval between the onset of each condition and the date of death."					
4841	"Part 1 - is used for diseases or conditions that form part of the sequence of events leading directly to death. The immediate (direct) cause of death is entered on the first line, 1(a). There must always be an entry on line 1(a). The entry on line l(a) may be the only condition reported in Part I of the certificate. Where there are two or more conditions that form part of the sequence of events leading directly to death, each event in the sequence should be recorded on a separate line."					
4842	"In any case you must record the disease, injury or external cause that resulted in the death. Do not record only the mode of dying, such as cardiac arrest, respiratory failure or heart failure."					
4843	Try to be as specific as you can. “Unknown” cause of death should be recorded in cases where thorough testing or autopsy examination the cause of death cannot be determined. Stating “Unknown” is better than any speculation on the possible cause of death.					
4844	"Always fully spell out all terms. Abbreviations can be interpreted in different ways. Terms such as “suspected” or “possible” are ignored in evaluation of the entries. For example “suspected Diabetes” will be interpreted as “Diabetes”. The four lines may not provide enough space for the chain of events. Do not waste space with unnecessary words. Some clinical terms are very vague. For example, “tumour” does not specify behaviour (see also last page of this flyer)."					
4845	"Duration - is the time interval between the onset of each condition that is entered on the certificate (not the time of diagnosis of the condition), and the date of death. The duration information is useful in coding certain diseases and also provides a useful check on the order of the reported sequence of conditions."					
4846	Part 2 - is used for conditions that do not belong in Part 1 but their presence contributed to death.					
4847	"Frame B: Some detail is frequently forgotten in Part 1 and 2 (Frame A). Separate detailed questions ask for detail such as previous surgery, mode of death or place of occurrence. Frame B is not shown in this information sheet. It is self-explanatory."					
4848	Cause of Death on the certificate - step by step					
4849	"Start at line 1(a), with the immediate (direct) cause, then go back in time to preceding conditions until you get to the one that started the sequence of events. You will get very close to the time the patient was healthy."					
4850	"Now, you should have reported the underlying or originating cause on the lowest used line and a sequence of events leads from the underlying cause up to the immediate (direct) cause in the first line 1(a)."					
4851	"Finally, record the time interval between the onset of each condition entered on the certificate and the date of death. Where the time or date of onset is not known you should record a best estimate. Enter the unit of time (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years)."					
4852	Example					
4853	Write clearly and do not use abbreviations.					
4854	Be sure the information is complete.					
4855	Do not speculate on the cause of death.					
4856	Do not fill in laboratory results or statements like “found by partner” (there may be separate fields on the form for this kind of information).					
4857	One condition per line should be sufficient.

6311	"Changes to this chapter include restructuring of the hierarchy, the inclusion of more current terminology, and specific groupings for single episodes of harmful use, harmful pattern of use, dependence, intoxication, and withdrawal by substance type."					
6312	"In the ICD–10, the numbers of large groupings, or ‘blocks’, of disorders was artificially constrained by the decimal coding system used in the classification, such that it was only possible to have a maximum of ten major groupings of disorders within the mental and behavioural disorder chapter (corresponding to the digits 0 to 9). This meant that some groupings were created that were not based on clinical utility or scientific evidence. In the ICD–10, for example, one block (F30-F39) is devoted to Mood (affective) disorders, while Anxiety disorders represent only a portion of a broad and heterogeneous block (F40- F49) called ‘Neurotic, stress-related, and somatoform disorders’. Another block ? ‘Behavioural syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors’ ? unites disorders that are unrelated in terms of clinical symptoms and symptomatology except that they have something to do with the body."					
6313	"Given the constrained structural parameters of the ICD–10, the developers of the classification provided a reasonable set of diagnostic groupings. However, the more flexible structural characteristics of ICD–11 make it possible to incorporate key features based on available scientific evidence and current practice for more optimal nosology."

6337	3.15.8 Differences between ICD–10 and ICD–11 in Chapter 08					
6338	There has been a major restructuring and movement of previous ICD–10 concepts in this chapter. A number of new concepts have also been added. Cerebrovascular diseases have been moved to the Neurology chapter and multiply parented to the Circulatory chapter. Transient Ischaemic attack (TIA) is now also located under Cerebrovascular diseases and appears in Diseases of the nervous system.					
6339	"ICD–11 sees a major overhaul in the organisation of the blocks which make up the neurology chapter. The restrictive decimal coding system of the ICD–10, with its capacity to contain only 11 blocks of disorders per chapter, resulted in blocks containing miscellaneous neurological entities which did not logically fit together, such as the episodic and paroxysmal disorders block, containing headache disorders, epilepsy, transient ischaemic attacks and sleep disorders. The ICD–11 now positions headache disorders, epilepsy and cerebrovascular disorders at block level, and sleep disorders at chapter level (Chapter 07)."					
6340	"Not only has the structure of the neurological chapter changed, but the approach to classification also integrates current clinical practice and advancements in the understanding of neurological diseases. In the time since the ICD–10 was published, enormous progress in the fields of genetics, molecular biology and medical technologies have been made. An increase in the number of codes is inevitable when one reflects on the recent knowledge gain in neurology, so a balance between comprehensiveness, clinical utility and maintaining a public health approach is the aim. The working groups tackled this issue by considering the more common disorders to appear in the chapter, with less common aetiological variations of these disorders being subject to a ‘double coding’ technique. One major change which illustrates the advancement of knowledge is the addition of a block entitled ‘Paraneoplastic and autoimmune disorders of the nervous system’. This block contains immune-mediated neurological diseases, a field in which knowledge has exploded in recent years. A second example of how the new version reflects molecular biological advancement is through awarding Prion diseases block status despite their rarity. Previously, they featured as part of the infections of the central nervous system block, but research interest after the major public health issue in Europe in the 1990s has led to new variants of prion diseases being discovered."
